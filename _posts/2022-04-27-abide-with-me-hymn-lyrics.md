```
Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens Lord, with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away
Change and decay in all around I see
O Thou who changest not, abide with me
```

## Sorrow and Change

I have been listening to the above hymn lately. The second verse above has resonated with me. 

Life changes very fast. The things we want to hold onto often fly out of our hands so quickly. The things we dislike can seem like they last forever. There are sweet and good things in our lives, that in God’s wisdom, he often takes away. With our natural perspective, it is only sorrow to see the river of life run beneath you. 

One place that I feel this sorrow is in music. A song like [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/0YnbCBn2UdoM5Y1l6Am5EY?si=351b798cde174eb4) has that bittersweet sound to it, talking about buying a motorcycle just to crash it. A lot of music capitalizes on that bittersweet feeling. There is something in us that recognizes that sentiment as authentic. Songs about death, poverty, depression, and other types of suffering have something that resonates with us.

## Happiness and the Image of God

Sorrowful stories: stories of emptiness, are some of the most relatable songs. The experience of emptiness is well known.
 
But to me something about that emptiness eventually hints at the reality of the Creator. If we know sorrow, surely we know what not-sorrow is. If this is Empty, we know there is a Fullness. The human spirit knows it has a Creator. 

> We have an idea of happiness and can’t reach it… we’re incapable of both absolute ignorance and of certain knowledge, which makes it obvious that we used to have a level of perfection from which we have unhappily fallen.  
    --Blaise Pascal, Pensées

We have an idea of happiness that we cannot fully attain in this life, but that we simultaneously cannot stop wanting it. This is because mankind was made in the image of God and that sin has corrupted us. 

Christianity does not pretend there is not sorrow and suffering. If you have seriously read the Bible, you know that those topics are taken head on. But only Christ can offer the remedy. Only the Great Physician can heal our wounds, because

	But he was pierced for our transgressions;
		he was crushed for our iniquities;
	upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,
		and with his wounds we are healed. (Isaiah 53:5)

Just as Jesus was the cure for the sins and idols of the pagan ancient world, he is the cure today for the sins and secular idols of our nihilistic, meaningless world. 

## He Who Is and Was and Is To Come

Only in the One who never changes can we find rest from sorrow. *Change and decay in all around I see*... That is the dreary picture that we see in this present world corrupted by evil and uncertainty. …*O, Thou Who changest  not, abide with me*. To turn our eyes to God is our rest and peace. Only He can calm our restless hearts and take away our anxieties. 

God is the one who does not change. When you can only see change and decay all around you, then call on the one who does not change: “Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today, and forever” (Hebrews 13:8)

## Conclusion

Turn to God who never changes. Jesus is the cornerstone. The foundation. Unmoved. Our society has rejected him, so we have sawn off the branch that we were sitting on. And what we are experiencing now is something the physicists call “free fall.” 

There is real sorrow in the world, but Jesus said, “blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.” We are “sorrowful”, said Paul, but “always rejoicing”. Become his disciple. His love will remain with you through all, and he will never leave you nor forsake you.
