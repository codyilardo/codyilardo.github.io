Our sister Sandra Mantellini has gone home to be with the Lord today. She was a shining example of the victory that has overcome the world. In her long battle with cancer, she bore up under every affliction with a steadfastness from the Holy Spirit. She made her robes white by washing them in the blood of the Lamb.

> And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? (1 John 5:4-5)

She overcame the evil one. She overcame this world, and now her Lord has promised her rest. 

> “Therefore they are before the throne of God,
> and serve him day and night in his temple;
> and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
> They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;
> the sun shall not strike them,
> nor any scorching heat.
> For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,
> and he will guide them to springs of living water,
> and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” (Revelation 7:15-17)

Even though our eyes have tears, every one of Sandra's tears has been wiped away from her eyes by the hand of Jesus. She has left the gathering of the church here. But the church here is in the midst of war. She has joined the church triumphant, and will there await us in victory. We will soon follow her there. Each soul must return to Him who made it. May He make everyone ready for that day we must give an account to Him. All roads lead to the judgement seat of Christ. While the promise of entering his rest stands, call on him, for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. 

_Heavenly Father, receive your daughter into your presence. Thank you for the blessing of her life among your church on earth, as she leaves to join your church in heaven. We praise you, who gives and takes away. Please give your comfort to her close relations. In Jesus' name, Amen._
