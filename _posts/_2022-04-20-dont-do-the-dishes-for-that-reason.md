## Introduction

There is a mentality that many have when they come to marriage of “how are we going to split things 50/50”, or the like. This represents to me a misunderstanding. Marriage is not like a business partnership, it is much deeper. Marriage is not a trade. Husband and wife are roles, with a higher Authority than either the husband or wife defining them. It is God who created the roles, and it is He who fills the posts. 

There was an excellent insight that I heard in [Brian Sauve](https://www.briansauve.com/) and his wife Lexy’s podcast *Bright Hearth* on the home. And they had such an excellent insight in there. They were talking about intimacy in marriage, and how to always avoid any kind of transactional understanding about sex. 

## Don't Do The Dishes For…

The advice was this: **Husband, never do the dishes in exchange for intimacy.**

Never, *never* let that even be a paradigm in your marriage. Dishes is just an example, but that kind of *this-for-that* is a transactional understanding within marriage, where God intended it to be understood as a garden (Song of Solomon 4:12). Permitting a wife’s shopping spree in exchange for sex is a very bad thing. Being cold to each other as retribution for something earlier in the day is a very bad thing. Basically, “sleeping on the couch” kind of remarks are not something to play around with in your marriage. Transactions like these are not what marriage is about. 

And the reason is this: that makes your wife into a prostitute. To do that kind of thing would be trading services for sex. That is wrong. Giving support and kind acts to one another, etc. are things that should flow from a place of love, not from a mentality of bargaining or cunning. Scripturally, the reason we do things matters to God. 

Giving and receiving love is not a bargaining chip. Sex is to be a glorious coming togehter. It is the flame at the heart of the household that makes the house a lovely place to be. It is the source of fruitfulness (children) and of warmth for the home. To reduce intimacy to a bargaining chip is to degrade something that is holy. You want to lovingly care for each other in such a way that the marriage bed is held in honor (Hebrews 13:4). 

You are one flesh, and you both love and cherish another. And you give yourselves to one another based on your marriage vows, *not* based on secret contracts and trades that you run in your head. 

### Husband: 

Your wife is not a prostitute. She is your wife: your glory (1 Corinthians 11:7), your crown, God has made her one with you, bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh (Genesis 2:23), your lady, she is part of you (Genesis 2:22) and all her beauty is your own. 

### And Wife: 

Your husband is not a client. He is your husband: your head (Ephesians 5:23), your lover (Song of Solomon 4:16), your lord (1 Peter 3:6), God has made him one with you and all his strength is your own. 

## Counter Cultural For All

This is counter cultural both ways. For the feminist world, it is offensive to say that your body does not belong to you, but to him. It is offensive to suggest that a wife should *gasp* submit to her husband (Colossians 3:18). For the secular manosphere machismo world, it is offensive to say that you should have *gasp* one bank account and have committed to having sexual relations only with her (Proverbs 5:15). It is offensive to say that you must lay down your life for her, and that you are to sacrifice for her good at your own expense. That there must be no lust after others, no porn ever, (Matthew 5:30) and that your body does not belong to you, but to her (1 Corinthians 7:4).

This only works in a Christian marriage, with a husband committed to being loving and gentle with his wife, as Christ is with us, and with a wife committed to being faithful and respectful of her husband, as the Church is to Christ. 

In our engagement, we discussed this. There is no 50/50 relationship that works. This thing is 100/100. Right away in marriage, you have my debit card. There is no 50/50 here. This is 100/100, full commitment. That is biblical. And we don't deny each other intimacy even if we are tired. We work hard to make sure this is peace, communication, and harmony, so no weeds can grow in our garden. 50/50 marriages are not going to make it in the long run.

## Conclusion

This kind of 100/100 marriage flows naturally from new hearts that love Jesus. If you know that your life is not your own, but belongs to Christ, to be obedient to him means you are willing to give that honor to another as well when He tells you to do so. 

None of this makes sense if you do not believe in Jesus though. It makes no sense to put yourself out like that if Jesus is not King. The best policy if Jesus is not Lord *is* to use cunning and trades and deciet, because that is all you can learn from the father of lies, the devil. Only with God as our Father, being made his sons because of His Only Begotten Son Jesus, do we get the example of true love. 

Each husband and wife must have the practical conversations about dividing the labors of life and household. But a healthy conversation on those things flows from a healthy understanding of marriage in God’s eyes. The Word of God is our standard, not our human cunning or self-seeking. We have much learning to do, and we must learn it by dying to self. We must learn it by taking up our cross to follow Jesus.
