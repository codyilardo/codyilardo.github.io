> "She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." (Matthew 1:21)

## Introduction 
Most people at Christmas time remember *that* Jesus was born. This is the *why*. His name was given to Mary and Joseph by the angel who spoke to Joseph. 

## The History of the Name Jesus
Joseph was told to name the child inside his fiancee’s womb a fairly common Jewish name: Ιησούς. *“Iesous”* is the Greek form of the Hebrew name, Joshua (Heb. יהושע). This name Joshua is a compound word, consisting of the parts “JO”, a short form for the name of the LORD, and “SHUA”, from the Hebrew word for salvation. The name means, "The LORD is Salvation." This would have been obvious to Joseph, Mary, and all of Jesus’ Aramaic and Hebrew speaking contemporaries. It is why the angel says to call his name Jesus. His name is significant because it 
1. Showed the purpose for which he came
2. Connected him to Joshua of the Old Testament, showing that just as Moses could not bring the people into the promised land, but only Joshua, so the Law of Moses cannot bring righteousness to fallen man, only the True Joshua.

## The Message
Jesus came to save his people from their sins. Notice that it is not sin in general: it is "their" sins. It is *OUR* sins. It is possessive. Jesus came to free us from our sins. Some hear the gospel and compare themselves to others. They think, "the people who have killed 5 people and are on hard drugs, they're the ones who need God." 

That is true, they do. But, he is the savior of all. God's salvation is for YOUR sins. Individually. Not sin as a general concept only, He wants to deal with them in you. Your sins are not the same as other people's sins, but we all have sinned and fall short of God's standard. Don't make yourself a judge in this life of who really ‘needs Jesus', as a way to suppress the truth of God and grow a hard heart. You will come to the end of your life and will see that *YOU* need Jesus. Come to Jesus, turn from your sin. Ask him, "*Lord, make me clean.*" Turn from your sins, and he promises eternal life and forgiveness of sins. Jesus said, "All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out." (John 6:37) 

## Conclusion
Jesus loved you and came to free you from your sins by his blood, and to give his life as a ransom. He promises not to reject you when you come to Him in humility. The rich mercy and forgiveness of God, through the blood of Jesus, *"cleanses us from all sin." (1 John 1:7)*
