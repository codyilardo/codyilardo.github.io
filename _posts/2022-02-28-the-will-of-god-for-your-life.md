The Will of God for Your Life

## Scripture
1 Thessalonians 4:1–8    
Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more. For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you. For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness. Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
 
## Introduction 
So this morning I intend to talk to you about the will of God for your life. I do not claim to have the gift of prophecy, but I promise that I can tell you the will of God for your life. 

## Starting Right 
Paul here is writing to the church in Thessalonica where he had planned a church. He starts this passage by reminding them. Before he gives them instruction, he points them back to when they became a Chrisitan. We need to start right. Jesus said you must be born again. Many Christian improperly birthed. To make any advancement in the Christian life,to walk and to please God, and especially to know the will of God, we need to start tight. The New Testament Pattern is Repent. Believe. Be Baptized. Receive the Holy Spirit. Jesus said I am the Door. Everyone who comes in another way is a thief and a robber. You must come in at the Door.

## God’s Will for Your Life
Don’t you want to know God’s will for your life? Many people ask that question. It is not that we don’t know God’s will. It is that we do know it, and reject it because it is hard. The great preacher Leonard Ravenhill said, “Christianity is not being weighed in the balance and found wanting. It is being tried, found difficult, and rejected!”

## Your Sanctification is God’s Will for Your Life
He loves you. He wants you to succeed in your walk with him. What a blessing that the God of the universe, who needs nothing, wants our success in sanctification! His will is that we be conformed to the image of Christ. We are so often running around like a chicken with its head cut off asking what God’s will is for us, while neglecting what he has previously commanded. How do we expect to tell us more when we neglect the clear truth he has already told us? 

God’s will is your sanctification. Anyone who claims that “This is God’s will for them” when it does not line up with the holiness of Christ is deceived. 

## What Does this Sanctification Look Like?
First, Sexual purity. Paul singles out sexual sin specifically, and lets us know it is God’s will that we abstain from sexual immorality. This is singled out specifically in much of the New Testament, as sexual morality affects every part of life. Most family issues relate to unhealthy marriages. Many people have a crippling pornography addiction. Most violent crimes have to do with a  sexual relationship, and most definately most of the extremely violent crimes. These things do not stay isolated either, but spread into other parts of life. 

Second, Self control. The word for “his own body is ” in Greek is literally  his own vessel.  
> Proverbs 16:32 Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city. 

Self control here is self control in general, but again emphasis on self control as it relates to sexuality: that we are not slaves to “the passion of lust” “Epithumias”, or lust, is used elsewhere in the New Testament in

- Romans 1 speaking of homosexuality
- Mark 4 in the parable of the weeds, describing the lust for riches
- 2 Timothy 2 of youthful lusts
- 2 Peter 2 in speaking of Sodom & Gomorrah

Also notice that we are told not to live “ike the Gentiles who do not know God…”
Knowledge of God always results in changed living. That does not mean immediate perfection, but any who claim to “know” God will have a transformation in their life. Knowledge of God accords with godliness:
> Titus 1:1 …for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness…


## The Holy Spirit is the one Who Sanctifies
> Ezekiel 36:26–27 And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. 

It is only by the Holy Spirit we can be sanctified, because He is the sanctifier. The Holy Spirit purifies and sets apart God’s people, and gives us a new heart. If we have the Holy Spirit, we will not want to grieve Him.

If you disregard the call to holiness, you disregard not man, but you disregard the Living God, who created you and in whose hands is your soul and very breath.
