> By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. (1 John 4:1–3)

## Introduction
If you were asked to tell the Christmas story, what would you say? Where would you start? 

Most Christmas sermons usually start with about 2000 years ago. They usually start with the shepherds in the field. The pastor talks about all the animals: quiet and sitting around the baby in the manger, and the congregation goes, “Awww.” They typically start with the wise men, and the star, and King Herod. They typically describe Mary and Joseph’s trip to Bethlehem, and the  inn that was full.

And this is all true and important. It is the history of our Saviour. But for this post we will be starting earlier than 2000 years ago. We will be starting much, much earlier in His story. 

## The Incarnation 
The early Christians made a *big deal* about Christmas. More accurately, they made a big deal about this reality: The eternal, divine, Son of God became a man. Truly God, and Truly Man. 

There were many, many controversies about this in the early church, and even in the time of the New Testament. I believe that is because this is a powerful reality that the kingdom of darkness despises, so it tries to cloud this truth. 

One way this truth is clouded in our day is hiding it behind cute manger scenes and peaceful, go-lucky music, or the distraction of a fictitious pot-bellied, red-suited, white-bearded guy.  

Satan hates the reality that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Look at the stories from Jesus’ life: Herod slaughters thousands of infants attempting to take Jesus out. Demon possessed men and women throw themselves at Jesus' feet. One demon asked the Lord, “Are you here to torment us before the time? I know who you are, the Holy One of God! (Mark 1:24)” 

*Incarnation* means becoming enfleshed. Jesus, who always existed, eternally being the Son of the Father, was born into our world as the Son of Man, the savior. *He defeated Satan and sin in the flesh.*

The quote mentioned above from 1 John is very telling. John says that whoever denies that Jesus truly came in the flesh is an anti-christ. The appearance of Christ should fill us with awe and wonder. We should see how absolutely terrified that the demonic spirits are of Him, and wonder, “Who is this that even the wind and waves obey him? (Matt 8:27)” 

## Conclusion 
This Christmas may you see the songs and hymns we sing in a new light, and behold the glory of the One to whom we sing them. 

And remember,
He is not a baby anymore.
He is the King of Kings.
