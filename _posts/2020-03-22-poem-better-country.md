### A Better Country, that is, a Heavenly One

The knowledge of two cities and of two men  
I, lately receiving, am thus and so bound  
By fraternity and love promptly to pen.  

One man and one city does daily surround  
All creatures that now do abide on the earth,  
And ever the multitude firmly impound.  

Without respect to degree, all flesh with mirth  
Ought to seek, and seeking hereunto, to find,  
As a miner his ore, the truth to unearth.  

Yea, the first man thou know'st, being of his kind,  
For fathers and fathers have told thee of him  
With their lives when any thy title maligned.  

Further, thou hast found him in solitude dim,  
In haughty looks and ruthless notions unseen  
When thy cunning heart does transgress on a whim.  

Thy employment is in his city obscene:  
That haunt of jackals—Sodom—called Babylon,    
That boasts without shame of Jezebel its queen.  

Strong drink, scarlet, silver, and gold does she don,  
Gifts of her lovers, the kings of the nations.  
The poor in her streets starve with naught to live on.  

Her delight is to spread abroad temptations.  
The blood of righteous Abel waters her fields  
And mammon drives all of her operations.  

By that man Adam the deep seed of sin yields  
Death, which following the trespass, took its seat  
As tyrant and o’er Eve’s offspring fear does wield.  

On account of the serpent’s vice and deceit  
Adam’s posterity falls to be rebels  
And mortal flesh and sin their union complete.  

Yet the Most High, beholding us, in our cells,  
Sharing the scraps of swine, did not cast Adam off  
Forever. But more, in tidings as bells  

The eternal Son meekly in a pig trough  
Took on our sin-burdened flesh. He ne’er transgressed,  
Relating a kingdom to the near and far-off.  

He was despised, yet the will of the Blessed  
Was to give, for the sin of Adam and all,  
His Son the Christ and forgive at their request  

Those in Babylon who, foreseeing her fall,  
Change raiment for that of another kingdom  
And in the cross of Jesus, die, once for all.  

They go from Babylon, now each a pilgrim    
Within her walls and a stranger in her squares  
To arrange for the better country to come.  

And then leaving the first man with all his cares  
They light upon the Second, who heav’nly host  
In ceaseless song do laud. Falling from their chairs  

Angels proclaim, “Worthy in city and coast,  
In sea and beneath, in heav’n and earth, art thou  
the Second Adam!” And sitting at His post,  

He rules yesterday, for forever, and now  
The City that Abram, Issac, and Jacob  
Did pine for and the Almighty, with a vow  

Confirmed. Moro’er to Moses, by the Cherub  
This City was guaranteed. It’s walls are called  
“Precious” and “Salvation.” Sun need not rise up  

Within them, for with Jesus’ splendor enthralled,  
His people always see. Sun or moon worthless  
Are in the City where henceforth is installed  

The Light of the whole world. His love and service    
Are the pleasures of His servants whom He has  
Redeemed as His friends by his own blood’s purchase.  

The City has foundations of bright topaz,  
Jasper, and carnelian pure. The river  
Of the water of life, shimmering bright as  

Crystal, and the tree whose leaves will deliver  
The nations from their infirmities are in  
Her streets. She is never moved for God is within her,  

And He is her strong buckler. All that has been  
In Adam, these former things, shall pass away  
Before the throne of the Judge of all wherein  

Books are opened. To be the first man that Day,  
To store sin in Babel, is to store the wrath  
Of the living God and with thy life to play.  

Heeding thy soul, fly now to an abundant bath  
For thy vesture; namely, the blood of the Lamb  
Of God who calls thee from Adam to the path:  

“Follow Me”

“The judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification. For if, because of one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ...as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous.” (Romans 5)

This poem that I wrote traces the Biblical story of redemption, focusing on the contrast between Babylon and Jerusalem, and between Adam and Jesus. The personification of Babylon is a powerful poetic choice of the writers of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel in the Hebrew Scriptures, and is carried into the apostle John’s Revelation. I have followed the influence of

- John Milton (primarily some stylistic choices with Paradise Lost),  
- John Bunyan (utilizing the analogy of a pilgrim and archaic language as seen in Pilgrim’s Progress)
- Dante (the terza rima form that I selected, using an interweaving aba, bcb, cdc rhyme with hendecasyllable lines, is used in Dante’s Inferno).   

There are too many scripture references to cite here, but the title is from the eleventh chapter of the New Testament letter to the Hebrews.
