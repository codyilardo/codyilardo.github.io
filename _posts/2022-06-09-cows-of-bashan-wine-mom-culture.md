## Scripture

> [1] “Hear this word, you cows of Bashan,
>     who are on the mountain of Samaria,
> who oppress the poor, who crush the needy,
>     who say to your husbands, ‘Bring, that we may drink!’
> [2] The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness
>     that, behold, the days are coming upon you,
> when they shall take you away with hooks,
>     even the last of you with fishhooks. (Amos 4:1–2)

## Introduction

The prophet Amos was sent to declare Israel their sin, and warn them of the judgment of God that would come if they did not turn back to Him. Here, God calls the complacent women in Israel “cows.” Oof.

The word of God is relevant to today. God is calling out the rich, middle class, soft-alcoholic, proud women of Israel. As I read Amos, I was shocked by how much this description sounded like the “wine mom” [stereotype](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wine%20Mom). The stereotype exists for good reason. It is super widespread in modern America. Go to Target, and take a look at the signs in the kitchen decor section. 

## Gold Rings and Pigs

In Scripture, there is a connection between true beauty and godliness. These women were at least at one point physically beautiful. They attracted a husband. But here, they are called *cows*. By **God**. This is because their sin has now robbed them of their true beauty. **Sin always will rob us of God’s good gifts**, it is just a matter of time **if the gospel of Christ does not first take our guilt away.** The proud man is robbed of the honor he tried to sinfully idolize. The liar is robbed of the truth. The greedy man will die, and leave all that he chased behind. The vain woman is robbed of her physical beauty. 

In Proverbs, the woman who is outwardly beautiful, but is foolish is compared to a pig wearing gold jewelry:

> Like a gold ring in a pig’s snout
>   is a beautiful woman without discretion. (Proverbs 11:22)

Sin is always ultimately ugly, and goodness is ultimately good. In the Kingdom of God, there will not only be nothing evil, but because of that there will be nothing bad or ugly. It will all be *very good,* once again.  

## Drunkenness, Oppression, Rough Marriage 

So what was the sin of these women in Israel? We see first that it was, “oppress[ing] the poor”, “crush[ing] the needy.” This also to me lines up with the "Karen" meme, where complacency and respectable, middle class-ness is a garden that grows a particular kind of weeds: namely the sins of oppression, meanness, cruelty, injustice, rudeness, entitlement, etc. 

Next, we see that they, “say to [their] husbands, ‘Bring, that we may drink!’” This here paints a picture that is so relevant to today. This looks like a perfect portrait of the “wine mom.” Wine mom culture is an unfortunate plague. It is in complete contrast with godly femininity as seen in God’s word. This is the attitude that says, *“I run on coffee, wine, and Amazon Prime.”*

“Bring, that we may drink!” (Amos 4:1) epitomizes the wine mom culture. I can see the kitchen decoration signs that hang in the kitchen of the woman described here:
- “I use wine when I cook, sometimes I put it in the food!”
- “Wine is my therapy”
- “Oh! Look, its wine o’clock”

We see that the sin of drunkenness and complacency here also has *affected the marriage*. The brash words of a drunk woman saying, “Bring me more wine!” to her husband is an **ugly** picture. That is not a picture that does not line up with the call of husband and wife to be a picture of Christ and the church. While Christ washes the church in the word, and is present with us in the holy supper of the bread and the wine, this picture is instead one of drunkenness, brash, loud, crude words, and *MooOoOoOoOoing*. She views her husband as an idiot. Her children as a burden. 

## Lady Wisdom

The brash woman here asks, “Bring me wine!” The wise woman instead, **is the wine to her husband**:

> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
>   How much better is your love than wine,
>   and the fragrance of your oils than any spice! (Song of Solomon 4:10)

> I say I will climb the palm tree
> and lay hold of its fruit.
> Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
> and the scent of your breath like apples,
> and your mouth like the best wine. (Song of Solomon 7:8–9)
    
And to this wise woman, **the husband’s kisses are her wine:**

> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
> For your love is better than wine; (Song of Solomon 1:2)

Apart from God, all there is to drink is oppression, poor marriage, and the ugliness of sin. With him is **truth, beauty, and goodness**. Go see the description of wisdom personified in the book of Proverbs. The book of Proverbs is a book from a king to his son. It sets before him **two ways**: the way of life and of death. Of the prostitute Folly, and the lady Wisdom. The adulterous woman, and the wife of his youth. The beauty of Lady Wisdom is greater. But God's word has included the ugly picture as well, so we will know to act with wisdom when we face the trials of life. Proverbs especially helps young men know what *kind* of woman to marry. God's word helps us see properly what is good, right, true, and **beautiful**, and what is not. 

## Conclusion

Go read the book of Amos. See a helpful summary [here](https://www.davidpawson.org/resources/resource/97?return_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.davidpawson.org%2Fresources%2Fseries%2Funlocking-the-new-testament). You will be surprised how first: evil the land of Israel had got, and second: how much we need the prophetic message today. There is redemption for all sin for those who repent. *There is a beauty that never perishes*. That is the “splendor of holiness” (Psalm 96:9). That is the never ending beauty of a gentle spirit (1 Peter 3). It is the beauty of Lady Wisdom, personified through the book of Proverbs, contrasted with the Foolish Woman of Proverbs. Even in the message of judgement, God offered a chance of repentance. But they did not heed it. May we not harden our hearts while it is the day of salvation.
