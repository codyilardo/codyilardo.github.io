## Introduction 

> “The joy of the Lord is your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10)

This verse has often become a meaningless cliché in our mouths, and we think it looks nice on a coffee cup. But the context is actually much more glorious. 

## Scripture

After Israel had begun to return to their land from exile in Babylon, there was all kinds of rebuilding to do. Much of this was physical, such as rebuilding the temple and the wall. But the worship of God had to be rebuilt, restored, and reformed as well. The people were sent into exile for their neglect of the commands of God, and they were under the disciplinary judgment of God. Now, God was bringing a remnant of them back to their homeland. Ezra the scribe was called by God to teach them to obey the law again after their repentance. On a special day, all the people who could understand were gathered together in the square, where a pulpit had been built for this very purpose. They listened for hours to Ezra read the Law. 

> [9] And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn or weep.” For all the people wept as they heard the words of the Law. [10] Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine and send portions to anyone who has nothing ready, for this day is holy to our Lord. And do not be grieved, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.” [11] So the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Be quiet, for this day is holy; do not be grieved.” [12] And all the people went their way to eat and drink and to send portions and to make great rejoicing, because they had understood the words that were declared to them. (Nehemiah 8:9–12)

## A Time to Feast 

After hearing the Law read, what was the people’s response? It was weeping. It was mourning. But that was not what God wanted in this moment. There is a time for weeping, but for Israel that time had passed. The time for weeping was when Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the other pre-exilic prophets had brought their warnings. The time for weeping was with Jeremiah in the book of Lamentations over the destruction of Jerusalem. 

But, now, when the people wept, Nehemiah told the people to stop weeping. He told them to have a feast with fatty meat and sweet wine.

> “Then he said to them, “Go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine” 

There is a time for weeping and repentance. There is a time to “humble yourself under the mighty hand of God”. But, that humbling is for an express purpose, namely, that  “at the proper time, he will lift you up” (1 Peter 5:6) There is an overly introspective frame of mind that can actually hinder our ability to effectively serve God. If we are wallowing in self pity when God has already forgiven us, we may be actively displeasing God. We are missing the work he has for us to do today. 

A repentant attitude does not mean despondency and sulking. A repentant attitude recognizes the severity of sin against a Holy God, but also rests in the kindness of God. The grace of God strengthens us to fight again. When Israel was brought back to the land, it was for the express purpose of restoration, and a reestablishment of the worship of the Living God. It was cause for celebration, and celebration was commanded. Our self-serious religious attitude is surprised by hearing God command, “throw a feast with good, fatty meat and good, sweet wine. Celebrate, because the joy of the Lord is your strength.” 

## The New Covenant 

Tertulian, an early church author, writing in about 200 AD, said, 

> “We count fasting or kneeling in worship on the Lord's day to be unlawful” (Tertulian, De Corona, c. 200 AD). 

He also mentions the same thing on Easter. While this is just a tradition of man that he mentions, I find it noteworthy that at least some in the early church found it to be wrong to fast or even to kneel on Easter, or a Sunday, because those days are for celebrating the resurrection of our Lord. They knew how to have holy joy and celebration for God’s salvation. 

In the new covenant, we, like Israel, are commanded to celebrate. Jesus, when instituting the Lord’s Supper, instituted a celebration. Communion is a time when we are to emerge with rejoicing. There is a time to fast. But there is also a time to feast. The joy of the Lord is our strength. This joy is the joy that comes from his forgiveness, from his grace, from his salvation. Nehemiah told the people to be glad that they “understood the words that were declared to them”. Similarly, we are to be thankful that we have heard and seen things that the prophets longed to see (Matthew 13:17) and that we have received a gospel into which angels long to look (1 Peter 1:12). 

Put your faith in Christ. He is the joy of the Lord that is our strength, for in him we have the joy of our salvation (Psalm 51:12).  Our joy, as we grow into full maturity, is being brought to completion (John 16:24). Then, leaving your sin behind you in the land of your exile, “go your way. Eat the fat and drink sweet wine” with the brotherhood in Christ to the glory of God.
