## Introduction 

Right now at our church, there are multiple young couples getting ready to be married. This has filled me with great joy, and is a sign of God's blessing on the local congregation. Young married couples are a great blessing to the church, and below are some thoughts on why that is cause to celebrate given the culture we are in.

## God's Design

God placed Adam in the garden to order his creation. He placed Eve beside him to help in that mission and He blessed them together have communion with Him in that mission. He commanded them together to be fruitful and multiply, to fill the earth and subdue it. There is great beauty in the picture we are painted in Genesis. Perfect communion with God, sinless bliss, and fulfillment in following the creator's commands. A larger family, with God as the Father, has always been the will of God for his world.

## The Enemy's Agenda

Part of Satan's agenda from the beginning in the garden has been to oppose the crown of God's earthly creation: mankind. He hates all that God is doing. Instead of *order, fruitfulness, intimacy, and community*, he brings *chaos, unfruitfulness, perversion, and isolation*. 

One of those two opposing lists of adjectives will define each person's life, and will define each generation.

Will it be *fruitfulness* in hard work, making disciples, and raising a family? Or *unfruitfulness* in laziness, and slavery to your own selfishness until you are 35?

Will it be *intimacy* in a God-honoring marriage covenant where the intimacy is blessed by God? Or *perversion* in lust, pornography, and broken relationships?

Will it be *community* in the fellowship of the saints? Or *isolation* in addictions to entertainment?

***Will it be Christ?
Or chaos?***

Marriage is not a man-made institution. Family *undeniably* has the fingerprints of God on it. That is why Satan and his slaves are so determined to try and demolish it. That can be seen in our culture through sexual perversion, infidelity, abortion, promiscuity, or just the general trend toward isolation in the younger generations.

## Reason to Celebrate

One person submitted to Christ is a threat.    
One man and one woman in a God-glorifying marriage is even more of a threat.     
One family that brings faithfulness to the Word of God across multiple generations: that is the trumpets of victory sounding for Christ's kingdom.    

Now imagine a united front of 10, 20, 30, 50. etc. of these families. That is such a dangerous threat to Satan's agenda of chaos, unfruitfulness, isolation, and perversion. 

What a threat to the kingdom of darkness! This is health and strength for the localized body of Christ. This is health and strength for making an impact at a societal level in the local community.

> Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go. (Joshua 1:9)

It is a lot of responsibility for all these young marriages. A lot. But in times of war, it requires risk and bearing responsibility to gain the victory. We have the opportunity; no, an *obligation* to testify of the glorious gospel of Christ with each of these future marriages and families, through faithful lives submitteed to God's word.

## Prayer

_Father, thank you for pouring your blessing on our church in this area. I ask you give our people fruitful hands, fruitful ministry, and fruitful wombs. Please continue leading and shepherding us as a body. Let us keep our eyes fixed on you. Let your blessing be on every coming marriage and family. Please give us boldness in the way we live to defy the culture and proclaim Christ with our lives and lips. All the glory is yours forever. In Jesus' name we ask it. Amen._
