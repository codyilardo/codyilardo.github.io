## The Face That Draws Us Away from Idols

I was sent the hymn “Hast Thou Heard Him, Seen Him, Known Him” this week by a friend. Listen to it below:

### "Can Alone From Idols Draw"

The [entire hymn is good](https://www.hymnal.net/en/hymn/h/437), but see the sixth and seventh verse here: 

> ’Tis that look that melted Peter,      
> ’Tis that face that Stephen saw,      
> ’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,      
> **Can alone from idols draw:**     

> Draw and win and fill completely,     
> Till the cup o’erflow the brim;     
> *What have we to do with idols*     
> Who have companied with Him?     

The face of Jesus "can alone from idols draw". Any attempt to turn away from an idol apart from Christ is just a turn to another idol. Even the atheist that says he turns away from God just turns to other gods: the gods of his own mind, autonomy, and pride. To attempt to leave idols for ‘nothing’ is impossible. This is because we are worshiping people. We were created to worship: [*Homo Adorans*](https://www.tobyjsumpter.com/man-homo-adorans/). We *will* give our worship to something. But as a whole, mankind has turned to worship the “creature rather than the Creator” (Romans 1: 25) which is the source of all our problems. 

### Idols and The Fight Against Sin

Only Christ’s face can draw our faces away from idols. King David prayed, “Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things!”(Psalm 119:37). This can be applied in the sense of our fight over sin. As Paul talks about in Romans 7, anyone who tries to just “stop singing“ has a really bad day. It is not doable in the flesh. Instead, we have to turn to God. 

In a battle with pornography, alcoholism, drug addiction, anger, homosexuality, greed, lying, and "whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine"(1 Timothy 1:10), the greatest weapon is Christ. Repentance is not *just* turning away from sin, it must be a turn to Christ. Sin is a transgression of God‘s law, which, in a sense, is like making an idol of our own desire. An idol takes our attention by becoming an object of worship that we control. But “the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus”(2 Corinthians 4:6), the love that he displayed in his sinless life and sacrifice on the cross, is good enough to turn our head. 

### Saved by Free Grace

It is looking to Christ with a fervent spirit, and putting our faith in him. That is how we began the Christian life, and that is how we have victory in it. It is not by moralistic do-good-ism. It is not by church attendance. it is not by being a “nice person”. It is only by the grace of God in the gospel of Jesus Christ who died on the cross and rose again for you. “It is only this gospel that is the power of God for salvation”(Romans 1:16). These “cords of mercy”(Hosea 11:4) are the only ones strong enough to pull down the statues of our idols.

### Idols and Culture

This concept can also be applied in culture. This can be a family‘s culture, a church's culture, a society's culture. Culture cannot just “avoid the bad”. The only thing that can turn faces from idols is the face of Jesus Christ. So we must proclaim Christ as Lord of all, and as the wonderful Savior that he is.

> [15] The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. (1 Timothy 1:15)

When we submit itself to Christ in his place as king, we reap his benefits, turned from darkness to light. We will see the church “turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come”(1 Thessalonians 1:9–10).

### Conclusion

We become [like what we worship.](https://seedbed.com/we-become-like-what-we-worship-psalm-115/) We will either worship the Living God, and be partakers of His divine nature, or we will worship lifeless idols and become stupid like them. So, the Apostle John, in closing his letter to the church, says,

> [20] And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. [21] Little children, **keep yourselves from idols.** (1 John 5:20–21)
