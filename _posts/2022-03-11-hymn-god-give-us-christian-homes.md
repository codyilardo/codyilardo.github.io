This is a hymn of my composition based on another hymn of the same name by [B.B McKinney](https://hymnary.org/text/god_give_us_christian_homes). This hymn is written to Short Metre (6.6.8.6) the same metre as hymns like *Breathe on Me, Breath of God*, and *Crown Him with Many Crowns.* 

# God Give Us Christian Homes

    God give us Christian homes
    Where Jesus Christ is Lord,
    His rule obeyed, His grace received 
    And His name is adored

    God give us Christian homes
    That Christ and Church reflect,
    Where man and wife both freely give
    His love and her respect

    God give us Christian homes,
    Where father seeks Your face,
    And takes his role as head of house 
    With wisdom, strength and grace

    God give us Christian homes
    Where mother knows Your way,
    And helping hands and fruitful life
    Bring glory to Your name

    God give us Christian homes
    Where children grow to be
    Disciples of the One who said,
    “Let children come to me”

    God give us Christian homes
    Where we are passing through
    This world that fades, and passing to 
    Eternity with You
