## Scripture

> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight. (Proverbs 9:10)

## Beginning of Wisdom 

Whenever I am feeling stagnant in my faith, this reminder always gives me the right perspective again. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. That means that without it, you cannot be wise. You can be clever, but not wise. 

It is step one in the right outlook on life. It is step one on making the most of life. It is step one in seeing the cross of Christ with the right eyes, to believe in him for salvation. 

```
The fear of God is lacking in our society, 
because it is lacking in our churches, 
because it is lacking in our hearts. 
```

This to me is the start of the fear of God: to simply behold God. To see his creation: his power, wisdom, and will expressed. To see in the scriptures where he has revealed his character, and the unique, amazing truth of his gospel. To hear of his justice: that no man is hidden from his sight, that we will all stand naked before his all-knowing presence, that the righteous will go to everlasting peace with him and the wicked to everlasting destruction away from the presence of his might. 

The fear of God is baked into our conscience also, but most of us spend our lives suppressing it until our consciences are numb. 

For me, I need the scriptures, prayer, the Spirit’s help, the fellowship of the believers, the Lord’s supper, and the preaching of God’s word regularly. These are means God uses to shape us into likeness to Christ, who is spoken of in the prophets this way:

```
There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse,
        and a branch from his roots shall bear fruit.
And the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him,
        the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
        the Spirit of counsel and might,
        the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.  (Isaiah 11:1–2)
```

We see that Jesus, the Son, in his becoming a man, walked in the fear of God, who is his Father and God, and our Father and God. He was perfect, yet set us imperfect, fallen men the example of humility so no one could think they are above humility. 

There is a mystery in the way God answers prayer, and in the way he works in us by prayer. I do not hear audible directions from God in prayer, at least not yet, but I do receive tangible leading by his Spirit. There is a shepherding that Jesus does on my heart, a convicting, an encouraging, a potter-ing, a shaping, a power. The skeptics have demanded an audible voice for them to believe, but even in the scriptures God rarely communicated that way. We see Elijah and the still small voice, we see Paul being led in his prayers by the Spirit on his missionary journeys to go this way and that. 

I make this point on prayer to say that there is no shortcut to fear God other than that. There is no book on the fear of God you can read to get it. It is the beginning of wisdom, so it is not by wisdom that you attain it. It needs to be the heart of faith that God sees in secret.

Blaise Pascal wrote, “Jesus Christ is a God whom we approach without pride, and before whom we humble ourselves without despair.” What a quote! We are safe to humble ourselves before God without despair. To humble yourself before imperfect man can set you up to be taken advantage of. Humility before God is much more terrifying because he is all-powerful, but at the same time, there is no despair in serving him, as he is all-good.

## Fear and Love
God is holy and perfect, but has given us free will to choose him or to reject his rule and the knowledge of him. He is found by those who come in humility and faith, and whoever trusts in him will never be put to shame. The fear of God is the beginning, but it is not the ultimate goal of our faith. The ultimate virtue in God’s cosmos is not fear, but is love. The fear of God is proper in our hearts, but that is to prepare us to be made right with God. He is the father who ran to meet the prodigal son (rightly fearful) on his way home. Jesus told the fearful woman who touched his robe for healing, “daughter, your faith has made you whole.” 

There is a love that removes all fear. This is the Love that came into the world for our salvation. Love is not that we loved God. Love is not that we are lovely. Love is this: that God sent his Son into the world to be the sacrifice for our sins that we might live through him. There is a sacrifice for sins. While the gates of repentance are open, freely enter them through faith into his kingdom. 

## Conclusion 
If God is the one you fear and serve now, then you will find him as a loving father with great joy at the day of judgement. He has made all provision for our weakness: Christ died for you! But if instead you scorn the cross, if you take for granted that the perfect Judge of all the earth will ignore your sin, then you will have cause to fear on that day. 

> Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with fear and awe, for our God is a consuming fire. (Hebrews 12:28–29)
