Click [here](/pdfs/on-all-the-saints.pdf) to read a PDF of Gregory Thaumatugus' sermon from All Saint's Day (Our November 1st) from around 270 AD. This 3 page sermon is full of awesome imagery on the victory over death that Christians have when they are persecuted because of the victory Christ has won already. I have updated it to modern English from the 1800s English I found it in. See Phillip Schaff's Ante Nicene Fathers, Vol 6 for source English transaltion.
