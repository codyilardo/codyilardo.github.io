## James 1:19-27

Here are some brief notes outlining a discussion James 1:19-27

## Quick To Hear, Slow to Speak, Slow to Anger
### V.19-20

This is simple wisdom. Quick to hear. Slow to speak. Ever been speaking to someone and they aren’t truly listening, they are just waiting for you to stop talking so they can say what they really want to say? God has given us two ears, but one mouth. 

He also says slow to anger. Why is this? Because God is slow to anger. Anger is an important emotion, given by God for the protection of the innocent and for the hatred of evil. But it is meant to be slow. God’s wrath and justice are terrifying, but he is slow to anger, and patient with us and desires repentance rather than the death of evil people. 

## God’s Word Able To Save 
### V.21

This verse shows us two things. Repentance from sin. Reception of the Word. These two things are how we start the Christian life, and how we continue it. Repent and Believe. He tells us to put away filthiness and rampant wickedness. Paul says the same thing in Colossians 3, where he says, “Put off the old man.” You brothers are here because you seek to do exactly that. But there is more than just subtracting the bad from your life. There is more than just emptying the dirt from the cup. There is filling it back up with pure water. That is the next part of the verse.

Then we are to receive God’s word. It says the implanted word. The analogy here is seed. Tell the Parable of the Sower if time permits. It says the word of God can save your soul. Save your soul. That is a pretty serious claim. Look at 1 Peter 2:1. He tells us to long for the truth of God’s word like a baby wants to get momma’s milk. Why? So that we may grow up into salvation. 2 Timothy 3:15 says that the scriptures are able to make us wise for salvation for faith in Christ. The word of God points us to faith in Christ, which justifies us before God. The word of God is the seed, through which we are born again. God’s word purifies. There is great power when you both receive God’s word with faith, and repent of your sin. Satan loses his grip on you. 

## Doer of God’s Word
### V.22-25

But, be doers of the word, not hearers only. You’ve probably met people who talk the talk but don’t walk the walk. Probably the biggest reason people give for not being in church: Hypocrites! Knowing the Bible doesn’t make you a Christian. Guess what: Satan knows the Bible better than you. That does not give us an excuse to not receive his word, but it means hearing alone does not make you right with God. “I’m a good person, I go to church!” will mean nothing to God on the day of judgment.  

The law of liberty. We are not bound under the law of Moses anymore because we are in Christ. He fulfilled the law. We no longer have to avoid pork, and sacrifice animals every year. But that does not mean that there is lawlessness. We are now under the Law of Christ. He is the new lawgiver, who has called us to further holiness. Sermon on the mount “but I say to you” if time permits. Law of liberty: summed up in two commandments. 

Elaborate on verse 22: “Self Deception” if time permits.

How crazy that we as humans can deceive ourselves. Some of y’all are so good at lying that you are buying your own lies! Satan doesn’t even have to try and lie to you, you're already lying to yourself. As you read the scriptures, see how often it says, “do not be deceived”. That is where the real battle is. The enemy knows that the truth is the most powerful thing, so his main weapon is deception. 

## True Religion
### V.26-27

The description of true religion that James gives is an elaboration of the greatest commandment. It is not to yell “Amen” in church the loudest. It is not to pray long special prayers. It is simple. Love Neighbor: Visit orphans and widows. Love God: Keep yourself unstained from the world

Need both pieces to fulfill this commandment.
