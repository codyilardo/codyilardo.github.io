In the book of Revelation Jesus is talking to the church in Thyatira. He commends them for their faith, service and patient endurance, but Jesus has one thing against them. 

## Scripture

> “But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.” (Revelation 2:20)

This is one of the only times we see the word “tolerance” or “tolerate” in the Scriptures, and it is in a wholly negative light. Jesus is correcting the Thyatirian church precisely for their tolerance. They tolerated “that woman Jezebel”, a woman who walked in the footsteps of her Old Testament namesake: the wicked and idolatrous wife of Ahab. They tolerated this woman who was “teaching” and “seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality.” They tolerated that which Jesus does not. 

## Tolerance & Love

Our modern culture loves the word tolerance. Tolerance is seen as the supreme virtue. If you are “tolerant”, all other shortcomings are given a pass, for the book of 2022 says that “tolerance covers a multitude of sins.” “Tolerate” is the command of the pagan culture. And anything short of capitulation will not be tolerated. Tolerance is not love. Our culture has been deceived to think those are the same thing. It conflates tolerance and love. 

Any parent knows that is not the case. To tolerate your child’s bad behavior is not loving. Proverbs even says that if you withhold correction, you actually are hating your child. Love seeks the good of the other person. It seeks this even at your own detriment, it seeks it self-sacrificially, it seeks it even when it doesn’t feel like it, and it seeks it even when the object of your love is wholly unlovely. But love does not tolerate wrongdoing. It is merciful, but it does not lie. It rejoices with truth. Love says, “I love you, even though this is wrong.” It does not say, “I love you, so I pretend this is right.”

To lovingly shine the light of Christ will cause some to label you with false labels, like “hateful.” There is such a thing as hate. But telling the truth is not hate, and tolerance is not love. It is not loving to approve of drunkenness. It is not loving to approve of hatred, or covetousness, or greed, or hypocrisy, or cruelty. It is not loving to encourage a man to cut off his genitals and say he is a woman. It is not loving to encourage homosexual lust. It is not loving to say that pornography addiction is ok. It is not loving to say that adultery is ok, or divorce is ok, or that sleeping around before marriage is ok. It is not loving to encourage Isalm, Hinduism, or whatever else denies the gospel of Christ, and tells lies about him. This is because biblical love does not tell lies. 

> “\[Love\] does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.” (1 Corinthians 13:6)

The claim that Jesus is Lord is such an exclusive claim. It is a claim that does not make the pagan gods very happy. Tolerance is very comfortable waters for the demonic powers to continue their deceptions. It is a comfortable haze of confusion that they are happy to operate within. 

## The Example Of Christ

But the light of Christ has come. It shone on the self-righteous hearts of the Pharisees in His days on earth, and it is still shining today.

> And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed. (John 3:19–20)

It shines wherever the gospel is preached. And every hearer can run from the light, to the comfort of the well-known darkness, or turn to God, and have their sin exposed. Your sin will be exposed by the light of Christ. It will be exposed by the brightest light known: the very eyes of God. But I have good news for you. It will not stay exposed. It will be washed away by the blood of Jesus Christ. 

Christ loved us even in our sin. He did not pat us on the head and say that our sin was “O.K.” Absolutely not! In Jesus’ days on earth, he spent much time with “sinners and tax collectors.” He loved and cared for those the Pharisees pushed aside.

## Tolerance & Forgiveness

The contrast we should see in the Gospels is **not** the “intolerant” Pharisees and the “tolerant” Jesus. The problem with the Pharisees was that they were hypocrites: They excused the sin in their own lives and accused others. But Jesus considered adultery just as wrong as the Pharisees: but He offered forgiveness. But Jesus’ love for the prostitute, greedy tax-collector, and drunkard was not an approval of their sin. It was an expression of forgiveness. Forgiveness acknowledges there was sin, and then loves and forgives anyway. The real Christian commands that take the place of tolerance are: hospitality, forgiveness, patience, and mercy. 

Far from tolerating our sin, He supernaturally takes it away, in the most loving act known to mankind. He gave His life for us, to free us from our sins by His blood. The first step in walking with Christ is always to be **intolerant** of your own sin, like you would not tolerate a splinter in your foot.

Jesus is very, very merciful to sinners. But His mercy is received not through those who justify themselves in God’s eyes, and demand that He tolerate their sins. His mercy is for those who confess their sins, call sin what it is, and turn the other direction. **Forgiveness is our true need: *not* tolerance.**

## Conclusion

Rather than tolerance of sin, we preach salvation from sin. The cross is not tolerant of sin. The word of the cross is the power of God for salvation for all who believe. Jesus died for your sins, not because He tolerates them, but rather to take them away. Amen.
