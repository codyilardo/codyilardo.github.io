## Two Popular Analogies, and The Historical Perspective They Represent

These two analogies represent the perspective historically called [modalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modalistic_Monarchianism). This was considered a heresy in the early church. It basically says that God is one in being and in personhood. It says that Jesus is the Father, is the Son, and is the Holy Spirit. It says that the Father, Son, and Spirit are not distinct persons of the Godhead, but rather that those are just names/titles that are applied in different circumstances to God. Here are two analogies commonly used that logically align with this belief, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

> “A man can be father, brother, and husband”

> “Water can be found in three forms”

These represent the modalism doctrine because they say that God is one in personhood, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are just different roles that he has played through redemptive history. I know many use these analogies, but I find them unhelpful because they give the idea that God is some sort of shapeshifter pretending to be his own father and son and the same time. This denies the historical Christian perspective that God has existed eternally in three Divine Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It says, rather, that those words just describe different “modes” of being for God. 


## The Scriptures Affirm That There is One God 

This is a point that I will not expound upon here, because it is so obvious and because there are few who would use the name Christian that would deny it. 

## The Scriptures Show A Plurality of Persons in the Godhead (The Trinity)

### John 10:29–30

> [29] My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. [30] I and the Father are one.” 

This is an amazing verse showing the Divinity of Christ and the truth of the Trinity. The Greek reads ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ πατὴρ ἕν ἐσμεν. It is important to see that Jesus said, “I and the Father are one”, not “I and the Father am one.”

This shows the distinction in Personhood, (ἐσμεν, first person *plural* verb) yet the oneness in Godhood (ἕν, the word for one).

### John 17

### 2 Corinthians 13:14

> [14] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. 

This Trinitarian blessing from Paul is important to note. If the three names above are just modes of God, Paul would not form such a blessing. The persons of the Trinity are distinct in various role and personhood, but one God. 

### John 1:1–3

> [1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [2] He was in the beginning with God. [3] All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 

The Word is what John calls the pre-incarnate Son. This clearly refutes modalism as Christ here is called with the Father, yet somehow distinct from the Father in personhood. He is also called God. He is not a created being, because "all things were made through Him." 

### Matthew 28:19–20

> [19] Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, [20] teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” 

The Trinitarian formulation we use in baptism is very significant. 

### Matthew 3:16–17

> [16] And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; [17] and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”

Here, at the baptism of Jesus, we have the fulness of the Godhead displayed. The voice of God the Father from heaven. The incarnate Son. The Holy Spirit descending like a dove. This refutes modalism. Jesus is not the Father or the Spirit. Jesus is truly God. These statements describe the truth of God's nature revealed in Scripture. We see rather the Father testify to the Sonship of Christ, and the full anointing of the Hoy Spirit upon him. The doctrine of the Trinity is clearly displayed. 

###  Others

In the New Testament, see Colossians 1, Philippians 2, the book of Hebrews, and many more. There are also many significant Old Testament passages, like Genesis 1, many places in the Psalms and the Prophets where the Messiah is describes with attributes of Divinity yet distinct from the Father, but eternally proceeding from the Father, etc. 

## Church History Affirms Monotheism and The Trinity

While I think the scriptures are enough to show us the truth of the Trinity, the testimony of the early church is helpful as well. The early Church affirmed all the pieces of the doctrine of the trinity, even before councils like Nicaea and Chalcedon. These councils discussed the verbiage of the Trinity, not because it was a new idea, but precisely the opposite: various heretical teachings about the Trinity were springing up, creating a need for such councils. At least in the issues of this specific council, they agreed on definitions for these things *because* there was near unanimous opinion from the biblical bishops. Here is an [article](https://www.mbu.edu/seminary/tracing-the-thread-of-trinitarian-thought-from-ignatius-to-origen/) summarizing the viewpoint of some various authors from the early church with quotations. I have the writings that are quoted here by the article’s author, and can affirm that they are not out of context and that the quotations accurately represent the early church discussion on the Trinity.

The Apostle’s Creed is a very early account of the faith attested by church history:     

I believe in **God, the Father almighty**,   
    The maker of heaven and earth.   
I believe in **Jesus Christ**, his only Son, our Lord,   
    who was conceived by the Holy Spirit  
    born of the virgin Mary.  
    suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
    crucified, died, and was buried;  
    he descended to hades.  
    The third day he rose again from the dead.  
    He ascended to heaven  
    and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.  
    From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.  
I believe in the **Holy Spirit**,  
    the holy Christian church,  
    the communion of saints,  
    the forgiveness of sins,  
    the resurrection of the body,  
    and the life everlasting. Amen.  
  
Notice that there is a clear distinction of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet a clear proclamation of monotheism. Also take a look at the [Nicene Creed](https://www.ccel.org/creeds/nicene.creed.html).

The Trinity is not something to be embarrassed about. It is a glorious thing to defend. We believe in one God. Our God is three in one. The divinity of Christ is a doctrine on which His church stands. We worship one God. We worship God the Father Almighty, in the name of the eternal, divine Son of God, who is the Word of the Father, and the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit. We worship in the Spirit, who is another Helper to be with us forever, our Comforter who clothes us with power from on high.
