## Scripture 

> To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. (Ephesians 3:8–10)

## Introduction 

Focus on verse 10: “so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.” How often do we think that part of God’s work in the gospel was to show His wisdom to the “rulers” and “authorities” in heavenly places. If we look to other places in the New Testament, Paul uses these words to refer to angelic powers. Later in Ephesians, he says that our battle is against the rebellious demonic powers, using similar language. To think that angels are looking on to what God has given to man through the gospel of Christ is amazing. The gospel is supernatural. It has spiritual significance that we, its recipients and beneficiaries, often miss, while angels look on with wonder. 

## Angels Long To Look

> [The Old Testament prophets] were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look. (1 Peter 1:12)

The good news has been preached to us by the Holy Spirit (through Jesus’ disciples). This good news is something that angels long to look into. What a thought. Angels are supernatural, *super* meaning *above*. They are creatures of God, but they are manifestly more powerful than us in natural ability. We see single angels kill entire armies (2 Kings 19:35), deliver God’s messages, appear and disappear at will. We see angels are compared to flame of fire (Psalm 104:4). We see angels serve before the throne of God. We see angels appointed to bring destruction, plague (2 Samuel 24:16), and judgment. 

To our understanding, the angels that have not rebelled are sinless. They are more powerful than us, they are above us in every natural rank, and we know that when angels appear to people in the Bible, they are always terrified. 

There once was a king of a large and wealthy kingdom. He had many advisors, wise, skilled, strong, and loyal. And he also had a son. The kings’ son was coming of age, and the king began to give authority and rulership to his son. But the king's son was a foolish young man. He often neglected his responsibilities. He was often lazy, and forgetful of his place as part of the royal court. But nonetheless, the king’s advisors did not open their mouths about the king’s son. They continued their faithful service to the king, and showed reverence for the king’s every decision, including the patience and blessing he bestowed on his son.

I think it is the same way with angels. They are the wiser, older, stronger advisors. They must look on our foolishness and pride with bewilderment (if angels can feel bewildered). But see what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God. Even with our imperfection, God is very merciful and will bring his work in us to perfection. He has called us his sons through Christ. And so we are. 

Yet these angels *long* to look into the things we have freely given to us. We have “every spiritual blessing in Christ” (Ephesians 1). Mankind, not angels, is who Christ helps (Hebrews 2:16). Jesus, the Eternal Son of God, became a *man*. Not an angel. So we have a glorious inheritance through Christ that angels do not. The angels, who were there as God laid the foundations of the universe (Job 38:7), want to see a glimpse into what we have.

*And we have dust on our bibles!* Lord, have mercy. The fact that angels are longing to look into the realities of the gospel of Jesus Christ should show you its greatness. The fact that angels are being shown a display of God’s goodness, might, and power in the spiritual world should make us realize how little we believe the truths we say that we believe. The “riches” of his “glorious inheritance”, to “know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge”, the blood of Christ, the cross, the Spirit of God inside us, the imputed righteousness of Christ that has made the sinner righteous, the resurrection from the dead, these glorious realites are at our fingertips. May we have this perspective in our individual lives.

## In the Church

Additionally, we know that angels are observing our life together as a church. We see angels involved in the work of evangelism in Acts chapter 5, 8, 10, 12, etc. We see angels involved in the birth of the church, and likely involved in each local gathering of believers. Back in Ephesians 3:10, it was “through the church” that this wisdom of God is displayed to the angelic and demonic powers. In the book of Revelation, Jesus commands a message to be sent to the “angel” of various churches of various cities (Revelation 2:1). Some Christians have spoken to angels completely unaware (Hebrews 13:2). 

Angels observe what we do in church. That should make us think and consider how we behave when we are gathered together. We should consider that angels see how we dress as well. To the church in Corinth, Paul writes that 

> “that is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. (1 Corinthians 11:10)” 

Of all the reasons he has already mentioned that a wife should have her head covered (be it long hair or a fabric covering) he now adds *because of the angels*. We should proclaim the gospel, sing praise to God, baptize, and take the Lord’s Supper like we believe that not only mankind, but angelkind, is looking on. Because they are.

## Conclusion 

When we come to worship God, we join the angels that never cease to sing praise to God. We join the servants of Christ who have died before us and now are in the presence of the Lord. Let us remember to look at the treasure we have. Let us remember the value of the gospel of Christ. It is of so much value that angels long to look into it. The saints will judge angels. Christ, the Ruler of angels, invites his faithful servants: 

> “The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.” (Revelation 3:21)
