title: "Help Understanding the Trinity"

A friend of mine was struggling with lots of questions about the Trinity, so I wrote up some resources for a quick look at answering some of their questions to hopefully provide some insight. I figured I would post it here as well.   

Let’s start with scripture. There are lots of philosophical arguments that we can get into, and those are cool and helpful if that’s where you’re hung up, but for me the most compelling are just showing from scripture the state of affairs. This one is a super good intro into the Old Testament framework for the nature of God and how he interacts with humanity.

Next one deals with some scripture directly, but also goes into the history of Jewish understanding about the nature of God. This helps a different kind of question. Some people object that later Christianity retro-jected the interpretation of the Trinity onto Old Testament passages. This video shows that is not likely because of the way Jews have thought about those passages: Their literature supports a plurality of personhood in the God-head.

This one mainly leaves scriptural  arguments and goes to the apologetics side to discuss the philosophical aspect of the concept. If the scriptural data points toward a Trinity, is that even logically possible? Helpful if that’s where the questions lie.

In terms of arguments from modern critics about the Trinity developing years and years late into Christianity, a helpful video is below. I also recommend [this book here: Hippolytus on the Trinity](https://www.amazon.com/Hippolytus-Trinity-Daniel-Robison/dp/1507710518/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=hippolytus+on+the+trinity&qid=1593365124&sr=8-1) from around 200 AD. Good price and was such a helpful short read for me. It was updated to modern language by my friend Daniel. I believe that Hippolytus is also referenced in this video here. The early Christian understanding is helpful because of how matter-of-fact they talk about such a complex philosophical concept. I think it may help you with some of the questions, and there are definitely differences between how modern people discuss the Trinity and how they did, especially when it comes to the role of Jesus: it's not that he is less God, but that in role he is sent, not the sender. This one is kind of long with no visuals but is a good throw-in-your-earbuds-as-you-work-on-other-stuffer.

Those can be a good place to start. These can help lay a solid foundation in thinking, on top of the already rock-solid foundation of 2000 years of church history that affirms the Trinity, and the fact that what modern cults like Jehovah Witnesses or Mormons end up doing is taking away from the true deity or true humanity of Christ. That is one of the primary reasons (among others) that their doctrines are deemed heretical.    

The nature of God is so amazing and above our faculties of reason, but in his kindness, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1), that Divinity may be revealed to us in a comprehensible and rational way. The various nuances of the Trinity are definitely cool to get into, but my number one advice is to read the Word of God, over and over, and study it with both an eye on the historical, contextual information and with an open, humble, awe-filled heart that recognizes our need for the Holy Spirit to lead us into all truth.    

Something very helpful to me that David Pawson, an incredible Bible teacher, mentioned is that we may not always intellectually fully understand the Trinity but we still experience the Trinity. Just like a young child does not understand, as an adult would, what a father is, we do not always grasp the nature of God in a perfect way. But, we do experience God in real ways as he reveals Himself to us and invites us into relationship with Him. We experience our need to repent toward God. We experience the amazing, heart-cleansing gospel of Jesus Christ. We experience His death in baptism. We experience His Life, His body, His blood. We experience the fellowship and comfort of the Holy Spirit. Call on the name of Jesus today. He is the source of true freedom that you are looking for. He is the Word of God, who came in the flesh to destroy the works of the evil one and to purify you. He was crucified and buried in your place, taking the punishment that you deserved for your sin. He rose again, giving new life and forgiveness to all who believe in him, and is the one appointed by God to be the judge of all people. Hope this article is a blessing, to the Glory of God the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Amen
