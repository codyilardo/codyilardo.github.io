> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. (Romans 5:8)

God demonstrated his love by the cross of Jesus Christ. 

## Not Just Words

The gospel is not just words. 
All the Abrahamic religions say, "God says..." That is hardly unique. But we preach Christ crucified. 
Only the good news of Jesus says, "God demonstrated..."

## Reconciliation

We don't just tell people that God thinks such-and-such about them. We get to tell people that God DEMONSTRATED his love. Not words only. The gospel is Godâ€™s power to save everyone who believes. It is substitution: Jesus in your place. Jesus, the sinless one, took on our sin, that in Him we may become righteous and reconciled to God. God makes his appeal to you: Be reconciled. Make peace with God. He has provided the way, and demonstrated his love through the cross.
