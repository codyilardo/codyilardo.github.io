## Introduction

When I was still in university, I was taking a history class where we covered Rome. As we spoke about the time of the empire, and specifically about the Colosseum, we talked about the empire’s use of entertainment. The Roman state put on entertainment for its citizens. Holidays, races, theater events, the lot. 

It hit me hard one day in that class: we were talking about how the Roman emperors built the Colosseum and put on entertainments for the people to keep them entertained, not because they were good, but because the people would be less likely to rebel. It hit me how all of our popular entertainment today is basically created by  a handful of very powerful, morally questionable companies. 

## The Colosseum and Netflix

The role that the pagan Colosseum played has not gone away. But the pagans have swapped it out for the entertainment industry. We still put gore and death before our eyes. Instead of “Hail, Caesar”, we pledge allegiance to one Hollywood, under Disney+,  with Netflix and free pornogrpahy for all.

If you have read Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, you have seen an expert diagnosis of the pornographic entertainment experiment that the kingdom of this world has been running. There is a sedating effect that entertainments can have, that twists our views and distorts our passions from what is right and natural. 

Any Christian living with their eyes open can see Satan’s agenda framed like this: “keep 'em entertained, and they won’t stand up against me.” The way to get closest to your enemy is to give him pleasure so that he lets his guard down. How many kings in history have been stabbed to death over a drunken feast?  

## Conclusion

Hollywood is far from virtuous, but we let them be the ones to tell our children’s stories. At the beginning of Disney’s rise to prominence, this kind of thinking would be viewed as conspiratorial. But now, the cultural influence of these companies is so obviously society-shaping. They are powerful: With the heart’s of the world’s children in their hands, they can sow the seeds of whatever worldview they wish, if we permit it. 

May this be a reminder to choose our entertainment wisely and to not just consume whatever is spoon fed to us. May this be a note to be skeptical of the food on the spoon when the hand that feeds it to you is the godless entertainment industry. May this be a reminder that the children’s stories we select matter greatly. May this be a reminder that we must believe in Jesus Christ, we must be born again, that our hearts and affections must be seated with Christ in heavenly places, above all rule, authority, and entertainment.
