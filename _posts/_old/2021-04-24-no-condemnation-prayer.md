title: "Prayer: No Condemnation in Christ"

I struggled for multiple years of my Christian walk with deep worries and moments of anxiety concerning condemnation, even after repentance. As I grew in closeness to Jesus, the feelings would come in stong, crippling my ability to serve him with joy. I praise God that his soveriegn hand led me through that valley, and prayers like this, with His Holy Spirit as guide, led me through to victory over those accusing thoughts. I want to preface by saying that there is a right place for the fear of God and a place for understanding the weighty reality of God's judgement on the wicked. But our enemy knows that accusing the true sons and daughters of God can cast doubt on our minds, so he will twist the scriptures and lie to us to make us doubt the very true promises and words of God on both sides of the picture: God is just _and_ merciful. 

## Prayer: No Condemnation for Those in Christ Jesus

I thank you, Father, for showing me the greatest love and sending your Son to die for me and be the propitiation for my sins. (1 John 4:10) Thank you that He is my eternal life and bread of life. (John 6:39) I thank you that you are good and upright (Psalm 25:8) and faithful and just (1 John 1:9) to lead us in what is right. I know your wrath comes upon the sons of disobedience. So I do not become a partaker with them. By your constant help I walk as a Child of the Light, exposing anything that needs to be brought to the Light of Christ to become light. (Ephesians 5:3)


I renounce the lie that you are not telling me what I need and leaving me in the dark about eternity. I instead confess that you have given me everything for life and godliness, (2 Peter 1:3) and with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared. (Psalm 130:4) I confess that you have promised to complete the good work you have started in me (Philippians 1:6) as I submit to you.
I renounce the lie that I will probably end up like those who say, "Lord, Lord, didn't we cast out demons... in your name? And I will say, I never knew you, depart from me, workers of lawlessness." Those people had known you as Savior in power but not as Lord in obedien. (Matthew 7:24) I instead receive your good warning, (1 Corinthians 11:32) Jesus, against hypocrisy, being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin, (Hebrews 3:13) and turning from humble obedience to you.


I renounce the accusations and fears that go against God's word in Jesus name and instead hold fast to my Head, Jesus Christ who will return for me to consummate my salvation as I eagerly am waiting for him. (Hebrews 9:28) I confess I am God's son, adopted not in name but in truth by the purchase of Jesus Christ (Galatians 4:5) and receiving his Holy Spirit. (Romans 8:15) I confess that you are my Father and I can ask of you anything and expect to receive in this life because by you are so good (Luke 11:13) and I ask to spend it on YOUR passions. (James 4:3)


I repent of (if applicable) doubt and unbelief toward your promises, Lord. Thank you for your precious blood that is cleansing me of that unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9) I take full authority over any spirit of Accusation, Condemnation, Shame, Fear, or Self-Pity in Jesus' name. I command you to depart from me now and go to the feet of Jesus.


I praise you Father. I give you glory for saving me from my sins, and redeeming me from Satan's kingdom through the cross of Christ. You are the Fountain of Living Water.
In the Name of Jesus,
Amen
