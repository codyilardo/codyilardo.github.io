> Lord, high and holy, meek and lowly,
> Thou has brought me to the valley of vision,
> where I live in the depths but see thee in the heights;
> hemmed in by mountains of sin I behold Thy glory.

> Let me learn by paradox
> that the way down is the way up,
> that to be low is to be high,
> that the broken heart is the healed heart,
> that the contrite spirit is the rejoicing spirit,
> that the repenting soul is the victorious soul,
> that to have nothing is to possess all,
> that to bear the cross is to wear the crown,
> that to give is to receive,
> that the valley is the place of vision.

> Lord, in the daytime stars can be seen from deepest wells,
> deepest wells,
> and the deeper the wells the brighter
> Thy stars shine;
> Let me find Thy light in my darkness,
> Thy life in my death,
> Thy joy in my sorrow,
> Thy grace in my sin,
> Thy riches in my poverty
> Thy glory in my valley.

## The Valley of Vision

The Valley of Vision is a beautiful prayer. It is the introductory prayer to a book of prayers from the Puritan era collected by [Arthur Bennett](https://banneroftruth.org/us/about/banner-authors/arthur-bennett/). Find a copy in a local bookstore, [here](https://banneroftruth.org/us/store/devotional-books/the-valley-of-vision/), and if you must, [here](https://www.amazon.com/Valley-Vision-Collection-Puritan-Devotions/dp/0851512283). 

Here is a great rendition of this prayer in song:

## Learn by Paradox

The Christian life is often a paradox. A paradox like this at first appears contradictory, but proves in the end to be true. 

The Valley is the place of vision. When we are surrounded by mountains of sin, we see the sky of Godâ€™s glory more clearly. When we are in the deepest well we can see the stars even at midday. When we are brought low, we behold God's goodness even more. 

**Pride and humility** are probably some of the most important themes of the Bible:

> God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. James 4:6

> Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain. Isaiah 40:4

I highly recommend checking out this prayer book. To our modern sensibilities, it may seem doom and gloom, but there is a sweetness and joy in it as well. They were hard on sin in themselves, because the had such a high view of how holy God is. 

> Let me find Thy light in my darkness,
> Thy life in my death,
> Thy joy in my sorrow,
> Thy grace in my sin,
> Thy riches in my poverty
> Thy glory in my valley.

What a powerful way to look at life. That is the crucified life. Following our dying and rising Savior, through humility to glory.
