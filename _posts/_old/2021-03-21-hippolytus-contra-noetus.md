## Excerpt from Hippolytus on the Trinity

Even though He was clearly shown to be God, He did not refuse the normal conditions that men are subject to. He was weary with hunger and hard work and thirst; He fled from danger and prayed in trouble. As God He has a sleepless nature, yet while on earth He slept on a pillow. And even though the very purpose He came into the world was to suffer, He begs that the cup of suffering might be taken away from Him, sweating blood in His agony. He taught men to disregard death by His work, and strengthened those who believed on Him, yet while on earth He had needed to be strengthened by an angel. He already knew what kind of man Judas was, yet He was betrayed by him. 
He who had been honored by Caiaphas as God whole in heaven was scorned by him when on earth. 

He is the Judge of the whole earth, yet He was judged as nothing by Herod. The One who took our infirmities upon Himself was scourged by Pilate. Though thousands of thousands and myriads of myriads of angels and archangels stood at his command, He was mocked by the soldiers. The very One who secured the heavens like a vault was Himself fastened to the cross by the Jews. He who is inseparable from the Father cried to the Father and entrusted His spirit to Him. The One who said He had the power to lay down His life and the power to take it up again bowed His head and gave up His spirit; yet being Life Himself, He was not conquered by death, for He said, “I lay it down on My own initiative.


He who gives life abundantly to all was pierced in the side with a spear. He who raises the dead was wrapped in linen and laid in a tomb, and on the third day he was raised again by the Father, though He Himself is the Resurrection and the Life. the One who for our sakes was made as we are, He has finished all things for us, for He bore our infirmities and carried our diseases, and for our sakes He was afflicted, as Isaiah the prophet has said. 


The One who was praised by the angels, seen by the shepherds, waited for by Simeon, testified of by Anna; this is the One who was announced by the star, the One whom the wise men sought. This is the One who was working in His Father’s house, pointed to by John, and testified of by the father from above with the voice, “This is my Beloved Son...listen to Him!” He has been crowned as the Victor over the devil. 


This is Jesus of Nazareth, who was invited to the feast in Cana and turned water into wine, who rebuked the sea in the midst of the violent winds. He walked on the deep as if it was dry land, caused the man who was blind from birth to see, and raised Lazarus to life after he had been dead for four days. He did many mighty works, forgave sins, granted power to the disciples, and had blood and water flow from his sacred  side when He was pierced with the spear. 
For His sake the sun was darkened, the day when black and the rocks were shattered. The veil was torn, the foundations of the earth were shaken, the graves were opened, the dead were raised, and the rulers were humiliated when they saw the Director of the universe close His eyes and give up His spirit upon the cross. Creation was tormented at the sight and shrouded itself in darkness, unable to bear the sight of His surpassing glory. 


This is the One who breathed upon the disciples and gave them the Spirit, who came in among them when the doors were shut. This is the One who was taken up into the heavens by a cloud while His disciples watched Him, and sat down at the right hand of the Father. And He is coming again as the Judge of the living and the dead. This is the God who for our sakes became man, and the Father has given Him authority over all things. 


To Him be the glory and the power, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, in the holy Church both now and forever. Amen
