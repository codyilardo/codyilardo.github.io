## Introduction

So this morning, I want to join you guys in looking to Christ.

A lot of teaching is focusing on practical tips. But Bible study cannot be just motivational self help with Jesus tacked on. But God’s word is not a stepping stone for you to reach “your best life now.” His word is the authority above us, a hammer that breaks stones in pieces, and a fire that consumes (Jeremiah 23:29).

It is not “self-help advice” that causes millions of Chinese Christians to meet in secret to worship. It is not self-help advice that causes a young Muslim girl to be willing to risk everything to become a follower of Jesus. 

It is the person of Christ, who is THE way, THE truth, and THE life (John 14:6). And his ultimatum: “Follow me”, that causes the true transformation. 

In 2 Corinthians, Paul says,

> “...we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.” (2 Corinthians 3:18)

So we are transformed through beholding the glory of the Lord. To see the glory of Jesus, and to believe in Him, changes you. 

So this morning, let’s come to God’s Word. If you don’t have a Bible in front of you, I encourage you to grab one. Let us together look to Jesus. 

One look to our Savior is worth more than any self-help advice I could give. 

## Scripture

> [1] The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John, [2] who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. [3] Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near. [4] John to the seven churches that are in Asia:

> Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, [5] **and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth.**

> **To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood [6] and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. [7] Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.**

> [8] “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”

How does John, writing by the Spirit, begin the Revelation? He starts it with a blessing, from God the Father, the Spirit, and the Son. Verses 5 through 7 are an amazing summary of who Jesus Christ is. 

## His Rule

#### Verse 5

Who is Jesus? First, he is the *The Faithful Witness*. In Greek, the word for witness is "martus" here, where we get the word "martyr." Jesus’ testimony is true. Read the gospels, and see what the words of Jesus point to. As C.S. Lewis has noted in his work *Mere Christianity*, when you honestly asses the words in the four gospels, you must arrive at the conclusion that Jesus is either a lunatic, a liar, or (who he says he is) **the Lord**.

Second, he is the *Firstborn from the dead.* He rose from the dead first, meaning that we, in Him, will also rise. He was shown to be the Son of God by his resurrection.

Third, he is the *The Ruler of Kings on Earth.* He is King of Kings. The center of our faith is a very political claim: *Jesus is Lord*. Russia may be invading Ukraine. Presidential campaigns come and go. But Jesus is Lord over it all. And Jesus is Lord over you. It is up to you if you will submit to that or rebel against that. He is the rightful King.

## His Redemption 

#### Verse 6

Here we see the wonderful work of Christ. There are so many treasures of wisdom you could study your entire life about the work of Christ. But center stage here is his work of redemption for us: *He loved us and has freed us from our sins by his blood.*  

This is red-hot gospel right here. He loved us. This gets lost on us because we live in such a self-centered society that assumes we deserve to be loved. But to think that the God of the Universe, who lacks nothing and needs nothing, who is not dependent on us at all; to think that He loves us is amazing. 

But this isn’t just a general love. It is specific. It is connected to our redemption. It is connected to salvation from sin. 

Love is not seen primarily on Valentine's day, flowers and chocolates, or weddings. **Love is best seen displayed on a bloody cross.**

He has freed us by his blood. It is the blood of Christ, that was shed in our place, that has made atonement for our sin. It was the sacrifice that took our guilt away before God. 

Next, He has *made us a kingdom of priests.* Some Greek manuscripts read *καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς βασιλεῖς*, meaning, "and has made us kings..." Jesus is a King, so we worship him. He is so much of a King that he can make others kings. He is a kingmaker. It is not only about what we are saved *from*, but also about what we are saved *for*. We are saved by God to be a kingdom of priests to him. He has saved us into a calling. 
 
## His Return 

#### Verse 7

First, let us just imagine this. John is exiled to an island. I imagine him on the shore, staring at the horizon. I think of the storm clouds above the waters, with him saying, “Look, he is coming.” The phrase “on the clouds” refers to the Old Testament prophecies that show the LORD as riding on a cloud when he comes to execute judgment. This shows that Jesus is truly God. "with the clouds" also refers to a prophesy from Daniel, pointing to Jesus as the Son of Man:

> I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the **clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man**, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. (Daniel 7:13-14)

Then, all will see him. Every eye will see his return. Do not let anyone deceive you, saying, Jesus has already come back secretly. [That is a deception that the Jehovah Witnesses’s believe, along with many other failed predictions of his return](https://www.jwfacts.com/watchtower/1800s.php). 

But *every eye will see him.* And all peoples will wail on account of him. That is a sobering thought. That the nations will see the Lord Jesus return, but for many that will *not* be a happy day. It is the day when the true king comes into his kingdom, and all other so-called kings are brought to judgment. It is where satan and his companions are kicked out of God's green earth.  

## Conclusion

*Even so, Amen*. Nonetheless, we hope for that day. It is a sobering thought, but for the servants of God, that is the day we are longing for. It is when we will meet our Lord, who will bring about the day that his servants will,

> "...hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat. For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes." (Revelation 7:16-17)
