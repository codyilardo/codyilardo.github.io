## Introduction

What would you give to know that you have all of your sins forgiven? Completely forgiven and forgotten about? What would you give? Think about it. What do you possess that you would not give up to obtain the full and complete pardon for all your sin? 

## Scripture

> [5] This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. [6] If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. [7] But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. [8] If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. [9] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. [10] If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. (1 John 1:5–10)

## Accusation

How does Satan attack you when you start following Christ? Accusation. If you have been born again, if God has taken your heart of stone and given you a heart of flesh, if the seed of the word has landed in your heart and grown, if you believe that Jesus is the Son of God… Two important things have happened. First, you have come to love God, when you used to dislike his authority. And you hate sin, when you used to love it. But Satan will now exploit that hatred for sin, by throwing despair and guilt upon you. A man who is ashamed is unable to fight well. A man who is discouraged and laden with guilt cannot overcome the spiritual battle of the mind. There is a spiritual battle for the mind.

## Cleansed by A Bloody Cross, Not by Church Attendance

The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. His blood, not kind words, not going to church, not being a good person. Forgiveness from God is real and powerful. And he is willing to make you clean when you come to him with faith:

> [12] While he was in one of the cities, there came a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.” [13] And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy left him. (Luke 5:12–13)

In other religions, it goes like this: Do good, and if you’re a good person, God will forget about the bad you did. But that is not how the gospel works. The promise is not only that God will forgive us our sins, but also that he will cleanse us from all the unrighteousness. There is a feeling of dirtiness that comes with guilt, that no amount of soap can wash. There is an uncleanness that no amount of therapy can take away. Only the blood of Jesus can take it away.

> “Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD:         
> though your sins are like scarlet,            
>     they shall be as white as snow;           
> though they are red like crimson,         
>     they shall become like wool. (Isaiah 1:18)            

## Effectual Forgiveness

Forgiveness enables you to fight and win. A forgiven man can be a confident man, with godly confidence. Nothing weakens your ability to fight and win the battle of the mind than a guilty conscience. A clean conscience is your best weapon for the next fight. There is a battle for the mind. So many lies of the evil one are based on past sin. 

**The forgiveness of God is effectual**. That is to say that it effects real change in us. It is not something that is purely a declaration of innocence, but it brings about a cleansing that changes our actions. Stand on the promises of God. Seek his forgiveness. Seek, seek until you have it, and have it by promise. This is how we conquer the evil one:

> [11] And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. (Revelation 12:11)

## Conclusion

John is writing to Christians. He is writing to those who believe in the name of Jesus the Son of God. Jesus is the Light of the World. There is no “walking in the light” apart from knowing him. He is writing to those who have stumbled on the path, but they have indeed started on the path. Come to Jesus, if you have not started on the path. Repent from your sins, be baptized, and receive the Holy Spirit. If you are laden with guilt, nothing in this life can take it away. Only the blood of Christ, which he shed on the cross for your redemption. Amen
