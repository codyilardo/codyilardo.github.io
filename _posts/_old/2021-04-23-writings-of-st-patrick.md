Click [here](/pdfs/st_patrick.pdf) to read a PDF that I compiled from [this amazing resource](https://www.confessio.ie/more/article_kelly#). The editing is not my own, I have just laid out the text in a readable format, and have included footnotes (some from others, some are my own) for reference. 

St. Patrick is a common name, due to the popularity of the holiday, but few know his actual importance. These are the only existing writings we have from him. 

These writings tell the story of an amazing man whose love for Jesus Christ led him to endure trial after trial to bring the saving gospel to pagan Ireland. For anyone interested in missionary biography or history, they are massively important.
