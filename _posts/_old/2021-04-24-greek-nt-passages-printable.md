## Introduction

Here are a few PDFs of guides I created and use to work through a New Testament passage a bit slower. There are three columns: English, NT Greek, and blank for notes. They are split into a verse by verse format that includes margins for notes. If you have a beginning or intermediate level of Koine Greek, or are looking to get started in Greek, these may help. I print them out and mark them up like crazy. It is more forgiving than marking up my Greek New Testament directly.
