## Holy Father 

Jesus had just finished dinner with his disciples. Before Jesus was arrested to be crucified, he prayed to his Father for his disciples. We read some of this prayer in John 17.  
 
> …Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. (John 17:11) 

> O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. (John 17:25 ) 

 

### How did Jesus pray? 

He prayed, "Holy Father". Only Jesus has taught us to pray in this way. No other religious figure in human history made the claims Jesus did, and no other figure proved they were the Son of God by rising from the dead. Jesus reveals to us the character of the Father, who "no one has seen" (John 1:18). The two words, "Holy" and "Father", when put together, show us what God is truly like.  

### "Holy" 

The true & living God is transcendent and far. He dwells in unapproachable light. He is morally perfect, eternal, and all-powerful. The highest heaven cannot contain him. He created space-time and has not beginning but is himself the beginning and the end. He is perfect in all of his ways, and his character is the very standard of goodness and justice. All creatures are naked before his eyes, and he sees the thoughts and intentions and actions of men’s evil hearts. He is utterly separate from us, completely set apart, and there is none like Him.  

### "Father" 

The true & living God is also imminent and near. His steadfast love is over all he has made, and especially on those who fear him. He cares for his creation like a parent cares for their child. He has crowned humanity with his special image. He is a God who keeps covenant with people. He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: three mortal men. He is near to all who call on him in truth. He is not far from any one of us. He restores the broken hearted and lifts up the humble. As a father shows compassion to his son, so God shows compassion to his sons. And now, in Christ, we can be his sons by adoption. We can call out "Father" to the God of the universe. He demonstrated his love by sending his Son, that we might receive adoption as sons and forgiveness of sins and eternal life.  

### Conclusion 

Only Jesus taught us these tow realities together: the other-ness of God, and the near-ness of God. He is utterly holy and majestic and unapproachable by us in our sin, but because of His great live, he has made a way for his lost sons and daughters to come home through Jesus Christ, and to call Him, "Abba, Father". In Galatians, Paul teaches that we are no longer to consider ourselves merely servants under the Law. We are "no longer a slave, but a son". Through Jesus, we are "born again" with God as our Father. Before, because of our rebellion, we were children of the evil one. Jesus teaches us God’s true identity, and he also changes our identity to a new creation in Him: sons and daughters of the Holy One.
