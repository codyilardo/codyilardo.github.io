### Truth in the Inward Being

> Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being... (Psalm 51:6).

I often find myself sitting across a table with someone who has my genuine friendship,
but is not walking with Jesus. Another common situation is to be speaking with a
brother who has begun a walk with the Lord but has been ensnared seriously ensnared
in some sort of sin. In these scenarios, I am often at a loss for words. As a disciple of Jesus,
I desire them to know the peace, forgiveness, and fellowship with God that is offered
them in the Gospel and which I have come to know. In some of those conversations,
I sense a level of awkwardness as the kingdom of God is brought up. Most people, disciple or not,
are surprisingly willing to talk about the Church. Willing to even discuss, at a distance,
religious ideas. But the atmosphere can take a swift turn when belief in Jesus and
repentance are discussed. Those are very personal topics. What I mean is not that
they are private, but that they are connected to the soul of the individual in a
way that other small talk cannot be. There is no way to get around the offense of
God’s appeal in Jesus Christ: *Be reconciled to God. Be made right with God. Make
peace with God.* These invitations of God through his Word for each of us need to
be dealt with. That “dealing”, where God works in us, is that discomfort I refer to.
The above verse exactly touches that struggle I have when trying to say something.
Whether it is in my own life, in the conversations mentioned above, with believers
when we struggle, with unbelievers in separation from the Father, the tendency
is the same: to flee from evident yet uncomfortable truths. That is one of the
biggest hindrances and vices out there and the root of much of our depravity.

God “delights in truth in the inward being”. What a rich statement! At first it sounds
obvious, but it is a stark contrast to the likes and passions and delights of mankind.
Mankind’s passions and lusts can be summed up in the word “falsehood”. The flesh loves
to lie for personal gain. The flesh loves to put a false version of ourselves forward,
to seek attention and acceptance by little lies. The flesh, in fearful self-preservation,
loves to flatter others. In pride it loves to be flattered. Worst of all, the flesh
loves to deceive itself, to lie to itself. But God “delights in truth”. This shows
God’s perfect holiness. He loves truthfulness. God looks at the heart. This is at
the core of true Christianity. Without truthful, honest dealings with God, we are completely
missing the mark and just putting on a religious show: One, for others’ (parents, friends, pastors, teachers)
approval, or two, to make ourselves feel like we are better people.

It is good news to see this verse in its context. This verse is part of a Psalm by King
David: The great man after God’s own heart (Acts 13:22) who had just fallen for serious,
serious sin. David is coming to God with tears and asking for mercy and forgiveness.
The Holy Spirit preserved this story as an example for our encouragement and guidance.
In his guilt and sorrow, David does not *ignore* God’s holy character that loves truth, but rather,
he starts talking about it. God sees into our inner being and knows us. God’s holiness,
his delight in the truth, is what makes sin and rebellion to him so sinful. That being said,
it is also what encourages us to come in repentance, because God, who delights in truth,
is merciful and gracious to those who step into the light.

God “delights in truth in the inward being”. God does not want lip service. There are some strong words spoken to Israel where God says that he hates their religious celebrations and sacred festivals. There are times where he seems to condemn their animal sacrifices. Did God do that because he changed his mind suddenly on that which he commanded Israel through Moses about festivals and sacrifice? No. He says that to indicate that while their “hands are full of blood” (Isaiah 1:14), that any external ritual is not pleasant to him, but rather it is an insult. God “delights in truth in the inward being”. He does not want your Sunday best when your Monday is still un-saved. He “delights in truth”. So, the reality is that God’s delight is not toward those in secret sin. That is not to say that he is not immensely patient and merciful to our failings, but we need to hear his firm word on this: He is a jealous God (Exodus 20:5), an all consuming fire. David later prays:

“If I had cherished iniquity in my heart,
the Lord would not have listened.
But truly God has listened;
He has attended to the voice of my prayer.” (Psalm 66: 18)

Jesus’ rebukes to the Pharisees are in this same line. Jesus did not come with completely foreign rebukes to the Pharisees. He often is restating rebukes that have already been given multiple times in the Old Testament prophets. One passage where Jesus confronts them:

>“And he called the people to him and said to them, “Hear and understand: it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.” Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” He answered, *“Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.* Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.” But Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.” And he said, “Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? But what *comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.* For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.”” (Matthew 15:10-20)

Jesus mentions that “what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person.” (Matthew 15:18). The religion that God cares about is necessarily externally expressed: “visiting orphans and widows in their affliction” (James 1:27). Even so, it first involves a love for God in purity of heart that seeks, by the Spirit. This is the love for God that leads one to “keep oneself unstained from the world.” (James 1:27).
Finally, the Lord’s words, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up” (Matthew 15:13), cannot be ignored. The only people that will remain are those who are planted by God. I believe this connects to Jesus’ words, “Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (John 3:3). The Christian life is begun with an acknowledgement that we are defiled, like Jesus spoke about. It begins with being planted by the Father into obedience to Christ. This is a wonderful mystery. The new birth, We need forgiveness. Through childlike faith in him, we receive the forgiveness and new life purchased for us by the blood of Jesus. Call on his name today with honesty, and be assured that Jesus will not cast off anyone who comes to him.

> “For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it;
> You will not be pleased with a burnt offering.
> The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;
> A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.” (Psalm 51:16)
