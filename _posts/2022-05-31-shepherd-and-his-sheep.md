## Scripture
> [27] My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. [28] I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. [29] My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. [30] I and the Father are one.” (John 10:27–30)

## Introduction

### Context
Jesus was in Jerusalem for a major Jewish festival, the feast of Dedication. Here He is talking to the crowds around him. 

The religious leaders, the Pharisees, who did not believe in Him, had come up to him and said to him, “If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.” (John 10:24) Tell us directly, not in a parable.

Jesus replied to them, “I told you, and you did not believe… because you are not of my sheep.” (John 10:26) Why did they reject Christ? **Because they were already hardened in pride**, rejecting the Father who sent Christ. 

### Sheep 

Jesus calls his people sheep. 
Why do you think he makes that comparison?
1. Absolute Ownership of the Sheep
    - Sheep are completely the property and possession of the Shepherd.
1. Absolute Dependence of the Sheep
    - Sheep would die without the water and food that the Shepherd leads them to. 
1. Absolute Vulnerability of the Sheep
    - Sheep are vulnerable to many predators, and depend on the Shepherd's protection.

## Who are the Sheep?

First, they hear Jesus’ voice. Do you hear Jesus’ voice? Hear his call to follow him? To leave sin behind? Second, they are known by the Lord. Not that we fully know him yet, but that he fully knows us.

> For though the LORD is high, he regards the lowly, but the haughty he knows from afar. (Psalm 138:6)

A manager knows his employees. A shepherd knows his sheep. Can Jesus say of you, “Yes, I know him/her, this is one of my sheep?”

Third, they follow Him. This is a life of obedience to his commands. The sheep follow the shepherd wherever her goes. No sheep is perfect in its following, just like we are wont to wander, but the shepherds correcting crook brings them back into obedience. So it is with Christ and his people. 

## Christ’s Care for the Sheep

Christ cares greatly for his sheep. O Christian, see here the love of Christ for his people that you have been made a part of. He *gives them eternal life*. How sweet to hear, “I give them eternal life…”

Also, his sheep *will never perish*. This is salvation from the wrath of God. The word for perish (ἀπόλλυμι) can also be translated t*o destroy, or to lose*. Hell is eternal destruction, where Satan and the enemies of God will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord. But Christ's sheep will never perish.

Even more, Jesus gives his sheep protection and security in his love. In trial and difficulty, no one can take you out of Christ’s hand. When a wolf or bear goes to eat a sheep, Christ is willing even to lay down his life for the sheep. No matter what man may do to you, no one can take you from Christ’s hand. No matter what sickness may come upon you, no matter what loss you may suffer, nothing can take you out of Christ’s hand. If Satan tempts and attacks you, if persecution comes on you, if your wife, sons, daughters and friends are taken, even if your very life is taken: No one can snatch you from the hand of Christ. 

## The Father & The Son 

The people of God are Christ’s special possession, and reward, given him from the Father. To be in Christ’s hand is to be in the Father’s love.

Verse 30 is an amazing verse showing the Divinity of Christ and the truth of the Trinity. The Greek reads **ἐγὼ καὶ ὁ πατὴρ ἕν ἐσμεν.** It is important to see that Jesus said, “I and the Father *are* one”, not “I and the Father *am* one.”

This shows the distinction in Personhood, (ἐσμεν, first person plural verb) yet the oneness in Godhood (ἕν, the word for one).
