Here are a few thoughts on leadership as a husband and father that I have been thinking about and praying on as I get nearer to that season of life. There is a need for balance in all these things, and as I 

1. look to God's word for wisdom, 
2. see the victories of godly families, and 
3. see the failures of ungodliness in families, 

I have been taking some notes on differnt aspects of leadership to keep in check. 

## Authority & Responsibility 

### Just authority makes you a ***dictator***

A husband and father with authority and no responsibility becomes a man outside the authority of Christ. There can be a temptation to be led by his selfish desires, and become a tyrant. His authority is wrongly applied because it is not guided by the law of God. To emphasize only authority emasculates a man because he no longer reflects the better and second Adam: Christ. He more reflects the false authority of the kingdom of darkness, which runs on guilt and fear, rather than love and obedience. _Responsibility gives the direction and rightful use of authority._ 

### Just responsibility makes you ***disaster***

A husband and father with responsibility and no authority becomes a man crushed under tasks that he has no power to carry out. He will become ineffective in leading. He is not in his place as head of his wife and children. To emphasize only responsibility emasculates a man, takes the wind out of his sails, causes despair, and encourages fathers and husbands to leave their families, because without experiencing the purpose of God to take dominion, they are missing something they were created for. _Authority gives the ability to fulfill the responsibility._ 

## Example & Instruction

### Just leading by example: Lack of boldness

Leading by example is a command in scripture. It is required for shepherds to not be domineering, but leading by example (1 Peter 5:1â€“4). That being said, there are also commands for fathers to bring up their children in the admonition of the Lord. There are commands for shepherds to rebuke with all authority. If a manager at a company gets to work on time every day, some of the coworkers will also get there on time because of internal stimuli. But, many will not. Quickly a culture can develop that assumes it is OK to get to work late. 

Adam was commanded to name the animals. To make definitions and distinctions. That is a challenge many times, and requires boldness, resolve, and reliance on God. Part of godly masculinity is to be able to call a spade a spade. To "Abhor what is evil, and hold fast to what is good" (Romans 12:9). Without instruction, and words that define things, family sees no reason for your actions but your personal preference, and no requirement to follow.

### Just Leading by instruction: Lack of relational love

Leading by instruction is a command also. "...preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. (2 Timothy 4:2)" That being said, there needs to be a life behind words, not just information. There needs to be deep relationship, patience, love, and trust that is the foundation of all instruction. 

Love is the fulfillment of the law of God, and the law to love our neighbor. "...for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law (Romans 13:8)." Without relational love, family sees no heart to trust behind your words, and no grace to be able to learn. 

## Prayer

_Lord, give me power to carry out your will in all that I do. Let me reflect Christ, and be equipped for every good work you have prepared before me. With my family help me apply your Word with a heart of boldness and authority and a heart of love and gentleness. Father, I humble myself before you. I bow before you, that I might stand in fatih to lead as you see fit._
