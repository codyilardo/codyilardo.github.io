## Introduction

Before my wife and I got married, our pastor met with us for pre-marital counseling. One of the questions that he asked us was, “What will you gain from marrying this person?” This question led to some great conversation. It is actually a great question for young people. For the modern ideas of love and romance, the question seems overly pragmatic. But it shines some light on the cracks in our modernist understanding of marriage.

## What Makes Marriage Special?

What makes marriage special? What sets it apart? The secularist answer is that love makes marriage special. And, what they mean by *“love”* is emotion and sexual appetite. That definition is why we see an American ~50% divorce rate. That definition is why we see so-called “gay marriage” made part of our laws, for if they *“love”*, why not? To the modern secularist, marriage is what you make it. It is a blank canvas for you to paint on in your studio apartment and little artist hat. 

But the biblical definition of the word marriage is different. Marriage is less like painting on a plain canvas and more like forming an LLC. It is more like a pilot selecting a co-pilot. Starting an LLC and flying a plane have predefined parameters. Marriage is infinitely greater (and weightier) than both of those examples, though, as marriage is the first and strongest earthly covenant that God instituted in Genesis. The *foundation* is different. 

Marriage is fundamentally instituted and owned by God. And he has decided that it be founded on a covenant, and not on emotions. And because it is something defined by God, and not of man, it has guidelines, parameters, rules and *gasp* roles. The secularist says that love sanctifies marriage. Biblically, it is the *covenant* that sanctifies marriage: the vows and their consummation. Only after that, the emotions and intimacy become important building blocks on that foundation that has been already established on Christ. 

## Marriage And The Benefits Thereof

The question, “what will you each gain by marrying this person?” makes little sense if marriage is a completely blank canvas for you to drag your emotions back and forth across. Marriage is a covenant. It is an institution. And as an institution, with pre-existing parameters, you can ask questions like the above. There are risks. There are challenges. And there are benefits. 

In a biblical marriage, a man gains *help, fruitfulness, and purpose.* 

> Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” (Genesis 2:18)

The fundamental thing that man gains in marriage is seen in God’s plan in Genesis 2. That is help. In his wife he finds a companion and helper in fulfilling God’s command to take dominion over the earth. God said it was not good for the man to be alone. Another thing that man gains in marriage is fruitfulness. Man cannot self-replicate. Neither can woman. For Adam to fill the earth and subdue it, Eve was brought to him. Women are multipliers. They take the raw goods and return it multiplied: Sperm, to a new image-bearing child. They take the bacon and return it breakfast. Finally, man gains purpose in that he gains responsibility and authority. He is now the representative head of his wife and children. As the representative of his family, He is called by God to provide for them and to lead them. This starts with his wife, and then children. He gains a focus and purpose in his labor. Hard things are done by men who have a family to feed. 

The primary gains for woman in marriage are *purpose, provision, and protection.*

Woman gain purpose, but in a different way than the man. If man gains purpose by receiving a responsibility from God, woman gains purpose in being part of that mission by her help. She gains a place, she gains belonging, she gains accountability. A woman who knows, loves, and receives that place from God, and is content in her purpose, is powerful against evil, and will be praised by her husband and children. Woman also gains purpose in that she will be the bearer of new children into the world, which is a glory at which, I am sure, the angels wonder. Additionally, woman gains provision. Woman gains the provision of her husband. She also gains protection. This protection is the physical and emotional protection, but also the protection that comes from being under a covering of authority. 

## Conclusion 

These areas of benefit are actually built into God’s design of the sexes. These are just some of the areas where God has intended marriage to be a blessing both to man and wife. It is a good thing (a very good thing) that your spouse is *not* like you. God has designed these things to be a great joy. The culture war we are seeing is *not* between the genders. It is ON gender. It is a hatred of God's design. God’s design for man and woman in Christ is a glorious picture of Christ and the church. 

I have elaborated on the past on some of these ideas in the other blog posts, [Marriage and the Culture War](https://codyilardo.com/blog/2021/09/21/marriage-and-culture-war) and [Why ‘Happy Wife, Happy Life’ Gets It Wrong’](https://codyilardo.com/blog/2021/11/02/why-happy-wife-wrong).
