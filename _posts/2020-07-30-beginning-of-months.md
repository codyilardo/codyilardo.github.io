“And grueling labor didn’t shake   
Your patient labor in the sand,   
When whips and shouting from the guards   
Made your burden the heavier?   
Without a light of prophet’s voice    
For years and years in Pharaoh's land   
What caused your hands to take the straw   
And now remember with a meal?”   

“Forgetting pain, my dearest son   
Though seeming to be wise,    
Is not the height of human peace.   
Redemption is a beauty true    
And forever crowns suffering.    
The mighty hand and outstretched arm,   
Conquered sorcery’s wicked charm,   
And sandaled feet, with staff in hand,   
Ran through a doorway drenched in blood.”   

Exodus 12:26–27   

[26] And when your children say to you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’ [27] you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the LORD's Passover, for he passed over the houses of the people of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians but spared our houses.’” And the people bowed their heads and worshiped. (ESV)
