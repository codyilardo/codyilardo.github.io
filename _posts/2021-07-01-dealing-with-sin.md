## Dealing With Sin: Truth v. Lies

| God's Way   | Satan's Way |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Fear of God | Pride       |
| Repentance  | Give Up     |
| Forgiveness | Guilt       |

I drew this chart in my notebook a few years ago, and have gone back to it multiple times. It is a helpful comparrison to show the truth for what it is, and lies for what they are. Every man, woman, anc child knows that they sin. What matters is how they deal with that information: God's way or Satan's way. 

## Fear of God v. Pride

The way God has laid out to deal with sin is this. First, the fear of God. The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and by it, one departs from iniquity (Proverbs 16:6). The fear of God is to recognize his holiness, power, and moral perfection in contrast with our sin.

The fear of God contrasts with pride. Pride does not honor God. Pride says, "I am God". Pride makes the creature shake its fist at the all holy and all good creator, and refuse to tremble at his word.

When dealing with our own sin, the first step is the fear of God. Sometimes, we are so quick to run as fast as we can over all that holiness and righteous-judgement-of-God stuff to get to his grace that we forget that "by the fear of the Lord one departs from iniquity". God's first step in the remedy is to come before his high throne with the fitting humility and trembling. Satan's lie is to be arrogant and ignore our sin in a heart of pride.  

## Repentance v. Giving Up

Second in the way of dealing with sin is repentance. This is the first word of the gospel that Jesus proclaimed in the Gospel of Mark, "Repent and believe the gospel". Repentance is changing our direction. It is turning around. It is turning away from sin, and turning to God. 

Just as sin involves our heart, desires, will, and actions, repentance does as well. It includes making right the relationships we have wronged, restoring what we have stolen, and stopping the sins we have started. It involves submitting our emotions and desires to God, and cultivating a thought life that submits to Jesus Christ as Lord, the one who sees mind and heart. 

Satan's lie is to "give up". When God calls the rebellious to turn around and return home, Satan's lie is to give up: "You're too far gone", "You can't change", "This is how you were born", "Everyone makes mistakes and no one's perfect... this is just what I've got to deal with". These sort of lies go directly in opposition to the gospel of Christ. Giving up is the opposite of repentance. Giving up the fight against sin refuses to put faith in the promises of God, and is a way the evil one encourages his slaves to stay in slavery. Pharaoh tried to tire out the Israelites to make them give up when God started to work his deliverance through Moses. Wicked tyrants are threatened by a repentant heart, because a repentant heart is almost a free heart.  

It is important to remember that even though repentance involves an engaged will and diligence, the Spirit of God is with us in it. There is a special grace and power that is provided when we truly turn in the first steps of repentance. It is God who is doing the real heavy lifting through the process. It is command of God to repent, but he is there watching for the prodigal son to return home, and runs to meet him when he is still on the journey of repentance. 

## Forgiveness v. Guilt

Forgiveness through the blood of the Lamb is God's ultimate remedy for sin in the believer. In the new covenant God has made with us, he promises: "I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more (Jeremiah 31:34).‚Äù We may not always feel this forgiveness right away. 

"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9)." 

That is why it depends on faith, and on God's promises, which do not change on our feelings. 

Satan's lie is to follow up after pride and giving up with a crushing load of guilt. This is ungodly sorrow, that paralyzes us rather than driving us to the feet of Jesus like the fear of God and godly conviction does. Notice how the lies of the enemy are contradictory: first, the lie is, "Oh, its not that bad! I deserve this sin because..." or, "Just this once!" But after leading us into rebellion, the lie is, "You're so horrible!" and "There's no hope for you, God does not love you." This confusion is a clear mark of the demonic nature of these lies. God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. 

God's way is for us to draw near through the grace of Christ, turn from our sin, receive pardon for our sin, be cleansed, and from there on bear fruit in repentance. The devil has already been defeated by Jesus of Nazareth. He is already a defeated foe, so he tells lies to deceive us so we will not experience that liberation. 

Forgiveness is not "getting off the hook" with God. No, there is One who has paid for our sin. Jesus died for us, his enemies, and proclaims repentance and forgiveness to all who have an ear to hear, so we may walk in newness of life.
