title: "Why Regolith Linux is a Fantastic Distro"

[Regolith Linux](https://regolith-linux.org/) is a super awesome Linux distribution. If you are already a Linux user comfortable working in a terminal, it will be a great fit.

I am relatively new to Linux. I got started just under 2 years ago. I started out on Ubuntu earlier this year, and have loved it. But still, I felt that GNOME was just a little slow on my older hardware. I heard an episode from [Choose Linux](https://chooselinux.show/) about Regolith and had to try it.

Regolith is build on the stable base of Ubuntu, but uses a different window manager. When I say different, I mean _very_ different. It uses i3, which is a tiling window manager. The best way to understand one is to try it: I can compare it to the way that programs like tmux handle panes. Instead of having floating windows, your window manager has snap-to fit panes that don't waste any UI space on borders and headers.

Frankly, I thought something would break. Some software would fail. But no. A few desktop programs that utilize a lot of popup windows were a little awkward, but overall everything is working smooth.

After a couple of months it has remained my daily driver btw.

The reason for that _everything just works_ experience is that Regolith, while using i3 as the WM, still uses a lot of GNOME system tools. This is a perfect combo, because GNOME's system tools help a LOT with things like WIFI and printing. Other Ubuntu-downstream items in the distro are apt, and the full Ubuntu software center. The distro as a whole has set up i3 really well, with items like i3xrocks and i3bars for a great user experience, styled with Xresources. While sometimes it is a little difficult to configure the Xresources, their [documentation](https://regolith-linux.org/) is well done. The default _looks_, as they call them, are super cohesive as well.

I think this a perfect balance between Linux power-user efficiency and intuitive features, not to mention the support of a big distro to keep it's core up to date. I hope that Regolith is around for a long time and continues to gain traction. It has a standalone ISO you can install, but also a PPA to use on your existing Ubuntu install.

Also, as you can see, finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
