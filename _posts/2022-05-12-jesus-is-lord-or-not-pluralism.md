## Introduction 

Jesus is Lord of lords or He is not. I was talking to a friend today about Christianity. He said, “What do you think about other religions?” We had a good discussion about Buddhism and Islam. He told me, “I think that all the religions are worshiping the same God.” This represents a common idea in our day, called religious pluralism. 

## The Uniqueness of Christ

The central claim of the Old Testament is that “The LORD your God, the LORD alone” (Deuteronomy 6:4). The central claim of the New Testament, if it is anything, is that Jesus is Lord.

> …because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved (Romans 10:9).

Christ is [unique](https://www.davidpawson.org/resources/series/the-uniqueness-of-christ). Read the four gospels. Either Jesus was a lunatic (he was delusional and we should ignore his words), a liar (he intended to deceive his hearers for some form of personal gain), or he is the Lord.

- He claimed to have existed before Abraham. (John 8:56)
- He claimed to be the Way, the Truth, and the Life. (John 14:6)
- He invited anyone to come to him, and he would give them rest. (Matthew 11:28)

These are not the words of a “good teacher” among many. He did miracles and forgave sins. He fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament. He said he came into the world. Not that he was born and ascended to enlightenment, but that he came into the world, to save from sin (Matthew 1:21) and to lay down his life as a ransom for many (Mark 10:45).

## Uncomfortable Truths for Itchy Ears

This is an uncomfortable truth to be confronted with. Many motivational speakers teach that it is just general “spirituality” that is important. Many so-called pastors teach, to tickle the ears of their hearers, that Jesus is not the only way to God. But if we look in the Old Testament we see Elijah, a prophet of God, boldly confronting Israel: 

> And Elijah came near to all the people and said, “How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.” And the people did not answer him a word. (1 Kings 18:21)

God is a jealous God. He will not share. He is an all consuming fire, and his glory he will give to no other. All truth is God’s truth, so all world religions have an element of truth in them because anything in our world needs truth to function. But a religion cannot be someone’s “personal truth.” Truth is a Person. And he has a name. He was born in Bethlehem. He was nailed to a cross. And he rose again. 

## Conclusion 

The question for you is this: did Jesus rise from the dead? Who do you think he is? Jesus is either the King of Kings, or he is not. There is no inbetween. As much as some of us would like to put him on the shelf as just another moral teacher, He has not given us that option. Many people think the COEXIST sticker with all the different people happily clapping their hands to what they each call “God” is what we need. What we truly need is salvation, and that can be found in no other name given under heaven than the name of Jesus. 

> P.S. A prayer for you, reading Christian: Lord, may we be bold in evangelism. Please raise up your servants throughtout the world to go and make disciples like you have told us. Forgive our lack of zeal, and let us proclaim the Lordship of Christ and salvation in his name wherever we go.
