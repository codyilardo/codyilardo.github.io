## Introduction 
Scripture passage is from Titus 2:11-14
What is the grace of God?


Essence of Christianity. When people think of Christianity, what do they think of? 


People saying, “I am a Christian”, or people claiming Christ


Beliefs belonging to a group called Christians


We are going to talk about that and what God’s word has to say.



_Let’s stand for the reading of God’s word._


Read the Scripture, loud, slow, and with authority 


Pray:
_Holy God, our Father, we give you thanks and the honor due to you. Would you give your blessing to the proclaiming of your good news. Let every heart be receptive to the truth, and give us eyes to see and ears to hear. Give me the ability, even though I am the least of your servants, to proclaim your grace, in the name of Jesus our great God and Savior, Amen._

## Titus 2:11-13
God’s undeserved kindness brings salvation to us. 


### By being for all people, the grace of God is both inclusive and exclusive. 


Inclusive because it is available to anyone. Romans 10:13 says “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”. It does not matter what social class you are born into or the color of your skin. Jesus said,
> “Come to me, all who are weary, and I will give you rest”


> “If anyone thirsts, come to me and drink”


> “Let the little children come to me”


Exclusive because it claims that you need that grace. Jesus said many things that excluded people. He said, 


> “If you do not take up your cross and follow me, you cannot be my disciple”


> “I am the way, the truth, and the life. Noone comes to the Father but by me”


> “Whoever does not obey the Son shall not see eternal life”

### How do you know if it is the true grace of God in your life?
1. Does it bring salvation?
2. Does it train you to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions?

If not #1, then it is just the law. It is just rules, and good morals. That cannot bring you salvation from sin. “good vibes” cannot save you from your sins! Admitting your unconscious biases and accepting whatever new ideology is being taught in the university is not saving grace. That brings shame and more law. 

> The Law detects, grace alone conquers sin. -St. Augustine 

If not #2, then it is dangerous self-deception. If you think you have God’s grace, but you are not growing in renouncing sin, that is not grace. Should we go on sinning so there can be more of God’s grace? By no means! Absolutely not! You are self-deceived if you think that grace is a golden ticket to live a lifestyle God hates. What does Romans 1 say the gospel is? Quote it: “for it is the…. POWER of God for salvation for all who believe”

Only the free grace of God, forgiveness through the blood of Jesus, can bring salvation and train us. 
Grace, received by faith, is not freedom to sin, it is freedom from sin.

## Titus 2:14

Jesus, the eternal, divine, Son of God. 
He gave himself...

### To redeem us from all lawlessness
    Redemption is connected with the idea of slavery. 
    We were slaves to sin, and Jesus paid the price for our freedom.
    We owed a debt of sin, and he paid the debt on the cross with his own life. 
    Sin is lawlessness. 
        We have broken God’s holy law
Jesus perfectly kept the law of God. He was innocent, but he died for our lawbreaking.

### To purify for himself a people for his own possession 
If you have read the Old Testamanent or been in church, you’ve heard how God delivered a people out of slavery in Egypt. Jesus came to free us from slavery to our sin, and to make us his possession. 
He came to get people that would belong to him.
Christianity is not about a set of beliefs that belong to people.  It is about a people that belongs to Jesus. 

```
It is not about, “do you claim Jesus?” Does Jesus claim you?
The question is, are you his? Are you his possession? Do you belong to him?
