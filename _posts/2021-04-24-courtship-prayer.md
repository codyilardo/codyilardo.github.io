# Courtship Prayer

Heavenly Father, I draw near to you in the name of Jesus, your Son, to lift my relationship with HER_NAME_HERE to you. Holy Spirit, please guide this time of prayer. I ask that you grant all of these requests, because you are a good Father who gives good gifts to his children. 

## For God's Glory

Be glorified in everything we do in our lives. Let your kingdom come, and let your will be done. Let our goal be to glorify you and enjoy you forever. Let your sovereign hand guide our lives, that in the coming ages you would be glorified for the great love you have shown to us in Christ. Our lives are about you, and you deserve all the worship and glory. We are debtors to your grace and mercy. 

Let us love you with our whole hearts. Be first in our hearts. Let us be kept from idols and false gods of any kind. 

I thank you for blessing us with every spiritual blessing in Christ in the heavenly places. Give us both gifts of the Spirit and fruit of the Spirit as you see fit. Let us grow in opening our mouths to be your witnesses. Let your face shine on us in this temporary life, whatever you choose that blessing to look like. Let us be used by you in whatever way you see fit. We put our trust in you. 

## For Myself

Holy Father, 
> Let me walk in the fear of you.
> Let me be mindful of eternity.
> Let me remember to put on the armor of God, and live as a soldier. 
> Let me be sober minded and watchful, and be full of the power of your Holy Spirit to be a witness.
> Let me act like a man, and be strong in you in the strength of your might.

Give me wisdom in this time of dating. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Lead my mind and imaginations. Lead my pace. Lead me in my words to be pure, heart-guarding, edifying, truthful. Let my thoughts, words, and actions about her be above reproach. 

I ask that you cleanse my heart from every form of wickedness that would damage a future marriage. Cleanse my heart from all self-pity, effeminacy, worry, and insecurity. Replace that with solid righteousness, king-defying trust in you, and godly ambition for your will. Let me see clearly by your Holy Spirit the mission and call before me, to direct the direction of my life and future family in the narrow path. Let me stand firm against the waves of immorality in culture, no matter the cost. 

Grant that according to your promise, I would grow in Christ-like character, being conformed to him, with my mind transformed by his death for me and resurrection life in me.

Protect me from every attack against your call for godly leadership. Let me remember that the head of every man is Christ, and that the head of every wife is her husband. Strengthen me not to shrink back from that authority. Let me take it up daily in obedience to Christ, and let me always use that authority to do your will in wisdom from above.

Let the only emotional foundation of my life be pure truth and righteousness in love. Protect me from demonic schemes of:

> Fear of man
> Fear of woman’s disapproval
> Cowardice
> Laziness and pride
> Negligence
> Lack of faith
> Insecurities about myself
> Comparison
> Complaining
> Compromise

Give me your supernatural strength to do the good works you have prepared beforehand for me to do. Empower my hands to bend a bow of bronze, and to conquer and subdue the creation around me to fulfill your command. Help me cherish, protect, and provide for her, and to take pleasure in the hard work you give me. 

Let all this be the fruit of your Holy Spirit, in Christ Jesus, in whom is all my trust and belief, for forgiveness of sin and freedom and victory over the kingdom of darkness. To him be the glory, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, now and forever. 

## For Her

Mighty God, 

I thank you for putting HER_NAME_HERE in my life. I ask that you wash her mind with your word. Sanctify her in your truth, your word is truth. Thank you for the blood of Jesus that is cleansing her from all sin. 

God, be forming her into the woman you call her to be. Let her love what you love and hate what you hate. Equip her hands for the good deeds that you have prepared specifically for her. Please be forming her into the woman who will be a wife and mother that will show forth your character, and will, by your Spirit,

> Stand along side me,
> Be a helper fit for me,
> Be my glory,
> Help manage our household well,
> And be fruitful in all areas.

Give her a pure mind, a pure heart, and pure hands. Protect her from Satan’s lies of subversion, like those of the serpent in the garden. Give her true, solid trust in your word, to be able to see the lies of the devil clearly. Every wicked, lying spirit against her, may the Lord rebuke you. I command you to depart from her in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whose name is above every other name. 

Thank you God for her gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious to you. Let that grow strong in you, to, in godly femininity, submit to my leadership and to lead our children in the way of life, so we can fulfill your command to be fruitful and multiply and establish a godly household in the earth.

Increase her wisdom and her love for you. Let her cast all her burdens on you, because you care for her. Give her righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, for the glory of your name, for her good, always. 

In Jesus’ name,
Amen.
