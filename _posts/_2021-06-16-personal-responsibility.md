I rediscovered this from a journal entry from 11/20/2020: 

## Some Advice to Myself

- Learn to delight in personal responsibility. Learn to delight in getting your own house in order.  
- Make a budget, work hard. It is a good thing. It is manhood, maturity, and a blessing to delight in. Work was part of God’s plan from the beginning, Adam was in the garden to tend it. God himself even worked 6 days before he rested, and he is utterly sinless. Ecclesiastes says that it is man’s portion to toil under the sun and take pleasure in it. Do it with this in mind: “Fear God and keep his commandments”.  
- The worship of God is your primary responsibility. If you put God first, all else will find its place. If not, you will become worthless like your worthless idols. 
- Do not shift blame. Be a man. Pray, "God, I ask for your wisdom. Please provide for me financially, for from you comes my ability." 
- Act honorably, according to Romans 2: Seek for "glory and honor and immortality" from God and in his eternal kingdom, not the praise of man.   
- Don’t be a lover of distractions. Seek entertainments and distractions in their right place. Some advice: Seek entertainments with hand-picked friendships, not in impersonal entertainments. Do not submit to the vain entertainments of the world that soften your mind to the truth of God and dull the edge of your alertness. 
- If you need alone time, find it in productive hobbies, nature, exercise, etc.
