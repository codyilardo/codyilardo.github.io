title: "Fear, Anxiety, and The Christian's Thought Life"

Most people deal with some level of anxiety. The most common response we often have is this:

1. We get a sense of anxiety and fear
2. We panic as the unpleasant emotions flow over us
3. We accept these feelings as "the case", and attempt to deal with them somehow

I have found that this trio is a common one. The thought life is so important. This is not a side issue. The mureders who are sitting in prison for life: Their issues started as thoughts that went out of control. The thief, the crack addict, the deadbeat dad, the promiscuous woman, never started out with aims to become what they did. There was a sin problem. There was a wound that never recieved the healing balm of Christ. 

Anxiety is very common amoung my generation especially. Sadly, it is like a gateway drug that can lead to all kinds of other deception, perversion, and suffering. It is a daily struggle to many Christians as well. If you are a Christian, if Christ lives in you, then there is hope beyond the above situation. 

## Anxiety’s Authority

As a disciple of Jesus, you do not have to listen to passing fears. They have no jurisdiction. It is like trying to correct a stranger’s kids. That doesn’t work so well. A good parent would teach their children to obey proper authority: themself, teachers, pastors, a policeman. But a good parent would also teach their children to *disobey* improper authority: the man who tells them to come in the van. The stranger who tells your daughter to jump on his lap. These are examples where you teach your children that aggressive, high handed, full-out disobedience is actually required.

To sum up this whole conversation in a sentence: **Anxiety is not your dad.** 

Fear is the man telling you, a child of God, to get in his van. The correct response is to bite his hand and run.  

This analogy is to show the nature of fear. Fear is trespassing on private property. It no longer has a right to you. Before you were in Christ, you were dead. You were spereated from God, a slave to sin, and cut off from life. But in Christ, you have been ransomed from your past ways. This means that the blood of Christ has, among many things, purchased you for God. You belong to him. And he is a jealous God. 

Something that Dr. Niel T. Anderson says that has helped me is this: Satan no longer has any rights to you when you are in Christ. He can only lie to you. He can only attempt to *deceive* you. If you really think about it, that is such a joy! Because a lie loses its power when you can see it is a lie. You don’t need complicated programs and worldly wisdom to overcome a lie. You simply *don’t believe it.*

You do not have to accept it. What I mean by “don’t accept it” is this: You are not to rely on the emotional wave as a true description of your situation or reality. You are not under any obligation to agree. I want to distinguish this refusal to accept from the *recognition* that the feelings are there. You are not ignoring any facts, you are just defying the invitation to despair. Godly wisdom recognizes the situation, but nonetheless trusts in God. Elisha did not say, “there are no armies surrounding us”, but rather, “Lord, open his eyes” (2 Kings 6:17).

In some real way, whether it is the world, the flesh or the spiritual forces of evil, there are *claims* and *lies* that are set forward with these feelings of anxiety. A sense of anxiety rarely comes alone. It comes with negative thoughts and desires. This seems to often be a demonic temptation. It is helpful to view these feelings (or at least the aim and accompanying dread from them) as lies, and not just as "anxiety". Then the despair from them is far from an inevitable reality. 

## The Good Fear

There actually is a good kind of fear and anxiety. This is the fear of God, conviction for sin, and concern about what God is concerned about. But know that this is always specific, and the Spirit of God works this stuff on our soul for our own good. 

If anxiety is the candy man in the white van, then this fear is your father’s good correction. And this kind of fear, the fear of God, is the beginning of wisdom. It is actually the antidote to the fear of man. The good thing is that this kind is specific, not ambiguous. 

## Trust & Distrust

That perspective is hard to believe in the midst of feeling the emotions, but it is a process of learning to trust God and distrust your own flesh. Learn to doubt your doubts. At the end of the day, “the righteous live by faith,” and “the life I live I live by faith in the Son of God.” We have been justified by faith, and belief in Christ is the life and water of the soul.

As a practical step to take in your thought life: “Is this from fear?” Is a question to ask yourself. Check and see, “Is this a weight of ambiguous fear?”  If it is, then it is not from God and you have all the reason to reject it and disregard its advice! 

God is a good father. He corrects and leads his children. That correction can be painful and hard, but God uses it for his glory and our good. 

A general and ambiguous anxiety on the other hand, is manifestly the work of Satan. It is not for correction unto repentance, it is just despair. That is the mark of a lie, and as we know, lies are not true.

## Conclusion

As usual, the claim "Jesus is Lord" sums up this post. Jesus is Lord. He is master, he has the authority, and not your emotions. Anyone who has struggled with anxiety at any time can find rest in the truth that their own feelings are not the king of their own life. Obedience to God is perfect freedom.

I want to place the qualifier that there are serious cases of anxiety that may require pastoral counsel. Check out [this post](https://codyilardo.com/blog/2022/03/25/christs-victory-over-satan) and the [resources](https://www.amazon.com/Steps-Freedom-Christ-Spiritual-Conflicts/dp/0764219421) referenced therein, and set up a meeitng with your pastor if you need help. 

Come to Christ: who is to us freedom, freedom, redemption, and wisdom. Jesus, and only He, will receive your burdens and give you rest.
