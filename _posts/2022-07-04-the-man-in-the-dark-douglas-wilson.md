## The Book

Douglas Wilson’s The Man in the Dark: A Romance is an excellent fiction novel that I just finished. From the back:

“Savannah Westmoreland has come to the town of Paradise Valley to start afresh. But when her mysterious new pastor and the town's most powerful businessman both begin to compete for her affection, Savannah realizes that she will have to face her past once and for all or leave Paradise forever. But there's more to the story--and more danger lurking--than Savannah knows.”

I am typically not one for romance novels, but if you are looking for some quality Christian fiction, then this is a great read. It is set in the early 1900s, involves mystery, crime solving, and the sovereignty of God. 

The book is published by Canon Press, and you can [buy it from them here](https://canonpress.com/products/the-man-in-the-dark/), or if you must, [here](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Dark-Romance-Douglas-Wilson/dp/1947644661). It is also available on their subscription service, [Canon Plus](https://mycanonplus.com/), as an audio book.

## Plot & Romance

First, reading the plot is genuinely interesting. It was not overly predictable, it showed a good deal of planning and authorial craft. Wilson is not primarily a novelist, but his fiction reminds me of authors like C.S. Lewis. You can see his intention to bring moral truth’s across, but it is done in a way that, if you have ears to hear, you are able to welcome. Some Christian fiction is done in a way that feels so fake that the moral elements seem to be just superimposed on a very fake-feeling story. I found this book to instead present a very real world, because we do live in a moral and spiritual world, with the plot telling a “true” story. 

Second, the book does a great job showing a bit of what capital 'R' Romance is all about. The story highlights some of the differences between men and women very well. The ways the sexes approach romance are laid out well: both the righteous and unrighteous examples. I listened to the audio book with my wife, and we found that we could both track and enjoy the story. Wilson obviously writes from a male mind, but his understanding of human nature means he writes both men and women well, and the story mostly has us in a female protagonist’s mind.

## Characters & Conversion

Third, the book does a great job at character study. The inner conflicts and conversations of various characters, while being on the introspective side, are well written. Elizabeth's experience fighting her conscience is a subplot that I found especially good. The author does a great job at showing what kind of person a character is, without having to explicitly tell the reader. Even when he does start telling the reader explicitly, the authorial commentary is very witty and enjoyable. 

Lastly, the book does a great job at showing the Christian experience of conversion, the battle of the mind with temptation, as well as the joys of true forgiveness in Christ. The process of Todd's redemption is powerful, and the biblical doctrine of conversion is weaved in very well to the story. The way God redeems sinners is truly the theme of the book, (as that is the theme of the story of this world that we live in) and Douglas Wilson does a great job getting the reader to rejoice in that redemption.
