## Scripture 
Titus 2:11–14    
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.

## Introduction 
In this passage, we see some important teaching on two very important topics. One, what is God’s grace? And two, why did Jesus die for us? What were Jesus’ reasons for going through all the trouble? We always hear that “he died for our sins”, but what does that really mean?

So let's look at verse 11 and 12, where we focus on what God’s grace is, and does in us, and then we will look at verse 14, where we will spend a little more time and really dig into it together. 

## Salvation and Training
> [11] For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, [12] training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age

The first thing grace does is bring salvation. Christ brings salvation. Any religious message that does not save from sin is just a club. Romans 1 says the gospel is the power of God for salvation. 

The next thing that grace does is train us. God’s grace saves us both from the penalty of sin, but also gives us power to live a new life. Christianity is not just about accepting certain things. It is also about renouncing certain things. 

In the early church, when someone was to be baptized, they had baptismal vows that they would repeat. After being asked to confess their faith in Jesus, they would be asked, “Do you renounce the devil and all his works?” God’s grace trains us to renounce ungodliness.

What an encouragement this verse is to me. It is a reminder that God is patient with our weakness. His grace is training us to live godly lives. There is a process of growing more like Christ that is underway in the Christian. Grace is not a license to sin. There is a deception very popular in America that God’s grace is like a sin-license. Some people have called it hyper-grace. That is the farthest thing from the gospel. The good news is not freedom to sin, it is freedom from your sin. 

## A People for Himself
>  [13] …waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, [14] who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.

I want to look at verse 14 specifically. Jesus came to purify for himself a people. He came to get a people for himself. He did not come to get a fan club. Jesus didn't come to get a Facebook following. Jesus came to purchase and purify a people to be his possession. 
Jesus isn't looking for one-night stands, or to hook up. He is looking for a ring. He is looking for lifetime, exclusive commitemnt. He is looking for commitment to follow him, and to belong to Him. 

That is why the relationship of marriage: Husband and wife, is meant to be a picture of Christ and the church. 

If we look in the Old Testament, we see God repeating a certain phrase. Over and over. It could even be considered the theme of the Old Testament. God keeps saying, “I will be their God, and they will be my people.” “I will be their God, and they will be my people.”

Jesus is the fulfillment of that promise. If we look at Deuteronomy 4, we read this:

> “For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of. Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live? Or has any god ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and by great deeds of terror, all of which the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? To you it was shown, that you might know that the Lord is God; there is no other besides him.

As God defeated the Egyptians and brought Israel out of slavery, So now in Christ he has defeated sin, defeated satan, and defeated death, and brought us out of slavery. God has always been looking for a people for his own possession. The central message of Christianity is not “do you claim Jesus”, but “Has Jesus claimed you?” Ask yourself, do I belong to him? Does he own me, or do I resist his rule?

How does Jesus take people into his kingdom? Most kings use the force of the sword to bring people under subjection. But Christ came to purchase us with his own blood. There was no greater price than Christ himself that could have been paid for our ransom. He came to redeem us. That is the greatest display of the love of God. That we can be redeemed through his blood, and belong to him.
