## Scripture

[21] And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. [22] And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. [23] And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, [24] “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.” [25] But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” [26] And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. [27] And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” [28] And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee. (Mark 1:21–28)

## Jesus’ Victory Over Satan

Jesus came and taught with authority. His popularity among common people was that he:
- Forgave sins
- Healed the sick
- Cast out demons

It was  not that he was the most charismatic orator. It was not that he had all the human wealth and status. It was not that he was the most physically attractive. But only Christ can bring true forgiveness of sins, healing, and deliverance from demons. 

Jesus defeated Satan. Demons knew his identity, often before people did. Jesus is stronger than Satan. He frees those who have been in slavery to the devil.

This "Jesus of Nazareth" is the name that demons fear. They fear his 
- Divine Sonship
- Sinless life
- Innocent death
- Resurrection in power
- Position at the right hand of God

He is at the right hand of the Father. He has the name above all names. There is a day when every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. Putin. Hitler. Your grandmother. President Biden. Your parents. Your kids. Every demon. Every church goer, and every pagan. Every knee will bow. Not might bow, but will bow, and every tongue will confess to Him. 

> Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil. (1 John 3:8)

Jesus Christ came to destroy the works of the evil one. He came to tear down the works of Satan. This is not a Jesus, meek and mild, who would give you a limp handshake. He is the one who has all authority in heaven and earth. He will throw Satan into the lake of fire one day.

## Conclusion

Those who were oppressed by demons came (or were brought) to Jesus while he was on the earth. Now the Lord Jesus is seated at the right hand of God. Come to him today. There are varying levels of demonic work in our lives. Some of you may have a demonic issue that you know about, and you are thinking of right now. Sometimes it is little things. There were times where I would get sleep paralysis. There were cycles of sin that I could not break. But Jesus has delivered me from the power of all of these.

There is true freedom in Him from *sin* and from *Satan*. Jesus of Nazareth, the Carpenter, is crowned Victor over the devil. Amen. 

I want to offer this booklet recommendation, [*Steps to Freedom in Christ*](https://www.amazon.com/Steps-Freedom-Christ-Spiritual-Conflicts/dp/0764219421/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=steps+to+freedom+in+christ+neil+anderson&qid=1648217699&sprefix=steps+to+freedom+%2Caps%2C110&sr=8-1) to anyone who is seriously interested. It is a workbook that takes around 2 hours to go through. I recommend doing it in one sitting if possible. It shows you biblically how to turn to Jesus for deliverance in different areas. It has been massively helpful in my own life.
