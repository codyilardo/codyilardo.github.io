## Introduction

The Bible calls Satan the “accuser of the brothers.” There are times in the Christian life where accusation and guilt come upon the believer. Every soul who has passed out of the City of Destruction, into the Way of Holiness knows what I am talking about. (If you do not, you will sometime in your Christian walk, or you have yet to lay down your arms and surrender to Christ.) 1 Peter says that these kinds of trials are experienced by all our brothers throughout the world:

> ...knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. (1 Peter 5:9)

## Christian in the Valley

This is an excerpt from John Bunyan’s amazing book, The Pilgrim’s Progress. Last night I was reading this section aloud to my wife, and was hit with how glorious and moving it was. In the allegory, Christian has already begun his walk with the Lord, and has entered the “Valley of Humiliation.” There he encounters one of Satan’s minions, named Apollyon. 

> APOL. Thou hast already been unfaithful in thy service to him; and how dost thou think to receive wages of him?

>CHR. Wherein, O Apollyon! have I been unfaithful to him?

> APOL. Thou didst faint at first setting out, when thou wast almost choked in the Gulf of Despond; thou didst attempt wrong ways to be rid of thy burden, whereas thou shouldst have stayed till thy Prince had taken it off; thou didst sinfully sleep and lose thy choice thing; thou wast, also, almost persuaded to go back at the sight of the lions; and when thou talkest of thy journey, and of what thou hast heard and seen, thou art inwardly desirous of vain-glory in all that thou sayest or doest.

## Accusation as A Tactic of the Enemy

We see that when Apollyon cannot convince Christian to return to his old life, he resorts to accusation. When Satan sees that he will not deter us from serving Christ through temptations, he will cast a net of accusation and lies. 
He points out to Christian that he has done a poor job even though he has just started his journey. He reminds Christian of his past failures, unbelief, and unfaithfulness. 

But Christian does not take the bait. The truth of God’s word, of his great and precious promises, overcomes the deceptions of the enemy. The belt of truth keeps Christians pants in place for battle. 

>CHR. **All this is true, and much more which thou hast left out; but the Prince whom I serve and honour is merciful, and ready to forgive; but, besides, these infirmities possessed me in thy country, for there I sucked them in; and I have groaned under them, been sorry for them, and have obtained pardon of my Prince.**

>APOL. **Then Apollyon broke out into a grievous rage,** saying, I am an enemy to this Prince; I hate his person, his laws, and people; I am come out on purpose to withstand thee.

>CHR. Apollyon, beware what you do; for I am in the King's highway, the way of holiness; therefore take heed to yourself.

>APOL. Then Apollyon straddled quite over the whole breadth of the way, and said, I am void of fear in this matter: prepare thyself to die; for I swear by my infernal den, that thou shalt go no further; here will I spill thy soul. And with that he threw a flaming dart at his breast; but Christian had a shield in his hand, with which he caught it, and so prevented the danger of that.

>...and wrestling with him, Apollyon gave him a dreadful fall; and with that Christian's sword flew out of his hand. Then said Apollyon, I am sure of thee now. And with that he had almost pressed him to death, so that Christian began to despair of life; but as God would have it, while Apollyon was fetching of his last blow, thereby to make a full end of this good man, Christian nimbly stretched out his hand for his sword, and caught it, saying, **"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; when I fall I shall arise" [Micah 7:8]**;

>and with that gave him a deadly thrust, which made him give back, as one that had received his mortal wound. Christian perceiving that, made at him again, saying, **"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us". [Rom. 8:37] And with that Apollyon spread forth his dragon's wings, and sped him away, that Christian for a season saw him no more.**

## Scripture in War

See displayed in the allegory the use of scripture in battle. The Scriptures are the Sword of the Spirit to us. Christian uses the scriptures not just as an ancient document, but as living and active weapons of his warfare, making bold use of,

> "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; when I fall I shall arise" [Micah 7:8]

And 

> "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us". [Rom. 8:37]

Jesus himself, when tempted by the devil, quoted the Scriptures. 
What an amazing thing, that even as mortals, Christ has given us power over the spiritual forces of evil because he is Lord over all. The spiritual battle we encounter on a day to day is not always fully known to us, but God has given us all we need for that battle and for the victory through Jesus. 

## Conclusion

How amazing is it that there is forgiveness for our past unfaithfulness, to the point that we can face the accusations that come to us, and say, 
>"Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy; when I fall I shall arise" [Micah 7:8]. 

That we can say with David,
>But with you there is forgiveness,
>that you may be feared. (Psalm 130:4).

Our great God, who delights in steadfast love, is very merciful. Turn to him, and your sin will not defeat you. Christ has already defeated it on the cross, where he was made sin in your stead. The accuser of the brothers is defeated, not because we have been perfect, but because God himself has forgiven us, and if God is for us who can be against us. Amen.
