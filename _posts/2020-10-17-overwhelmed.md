## Lukewarm Coffee

When Jesus wanted to rebuke the Church in Laodicea, he said that they were “lukewarm”.
Not hot, not cold. It is bad for us to be cold to God’s truth.
It is worse for us to be lifelessly lukewarm. That lukewarmness distances us from God
and is a wedge in our relationship with him, and does us harm. The late Bible teacher
David Pawson once said we have stopped worshipping God Almighty and have started to worship,
“God All-Matey”. Our land has lost the fear of God. Why is that? Is it because the genes of today
are less God-fearing? No, it is because those who name the name of Christ have lost the fear
of God first. We are not overwhelmed like Jacob, who said “Surely God is in this place!”
We are not overwhelmed like Moses, who said, “I tremble”. We are not overwhelmed like the Roman
centurion watching the crucifixion, who cried, “Surely this man was the Son of God!”

## We Should Be Overwhelmed at His Judgements

We ought to be overwhelmed by God’s righteousness. His holiness. It is not just that we should in a moral sense, but rather that such reverence is due to the Almighty. It is always fitting for his creation to respond with awe and wonder at his ways. When God’s throne is placed for judgement, “earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them”(Revelation 20:11). From God’s holy presence, heaven and earth themselves fled from the Holy One. When Isaiah saw the Lord, “high and lifted up”, he said, “Woe is me!”.

A dangerous tendency among God’s people is to ease off the hard lines that God has spoken in His word. The truth is sometimes hidden in a veil of qualifiers, exceptions, and commentary. God’s great judgements are not in the Bible just for us to explain away, “bcuz grace”. We see God’s righteous character and the sinfulness of our own character in his judgements. In the books of Acts, the Holy Spirit put Annanias and Sapphira to death for lying, and “fear came upon all the church”(Acts 5:11). When we treat the subject of hell lightly, we treat a holy thing as common. This is one reason why our speech changes when we become a new creation in Christ. When we joke about hell, we display our lack of true, deep belief of God’s word. We disobey our Lord who said, “fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell”(Luke 12:5). When we ignore God’s warnings and take his word lightly, we walk in the footsteps of the false prophets of Jeremiah’s day, whom God rebuked, saying, “What is the chaff to the wheat?... Is not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?”(Jeremiah 23:28-29).

## We Should Be Overwhelmed at His Mercies

Paul said to the Roman church, “Note then the kindness and the severity of God”(Romans 11:22). “Noting” it is one way to put it. We should note his severity the way a man notes a lion's roar behind him. We should note his goodness the way an orphan notes the day of his upcoming adoption. God’s mercies, which are “new every morning”, ought to be wondered at more than his judgements, because they are not deserved. God did not love us because we are lovely. He loves us because “God is love”(1 John 4:16). Overwhelming love is in the character of God. The woman, who “was a sinner”, washed Jesus' feet with her tears and poured expensive ointment on them. The woman, overwhelmed by God’s mercy, expressed true love for our Lord. And what did the Saviour say to her accusers? “He who is forgiven little loves little”(Luke 7:47). She realized she had been forgiven much, while the Pharisees did not. God’s faithfulness and kindness is what truly overwhelms:

	"Great is Thy faithfulness, " O God my Father,
	There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
	Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not
	As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

The love of Christ truly, “surpasses knowledge”(Ephesians 3:19). After a long discourse on God’s love shown us in Jesus Christ through the Spirit, Paul tells us, “So then, brothers, we are debtors”(Romans 8:12). We are debtors to God’s great grace. We should be overwhelmed by the love of God shown to us. That is a major theme of the Bible: God’s redemption and love for fallen rebels and slaves which results in our reciprocation of that love. The person of Jesus, truly seen, is overwhelming. His love shown to his own is seen in his promise of eternal life:

    They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;
        the sun shall not strike them,
        nor any scorching heat.
    For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,
        and he will guide them to springs of living water,
    and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes”(Revelation 7:16–17).

This is how the righteous men of old endured trial in this life: by faith “seeing him who is invisible”(Hebrews 11:27). John says, “See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God...”(1 John 3:1) Do we see it? Barely. The depths are unsearchable. But he continues the sentence, “...and so we are”. The amazing thing is while we cannot fathom God’s great love, because he has truly called us his children, we are. In Christ, we are God’s beloved children, because He said so.

To conclude this section, here is an excerpt from The Letter to Diognetus, c. 100 AD. We should be overwhelmed:

	“...how the one love of God, through exceeding regard for men,
	did not regard us with hatred, nor thrust us away, nor remember our
	iniquity against us, but showed great long-suffering,
	and bore with us, He Himself took on Him the burden of our iniquities,
	He gave His own Son as a ransom for us, the holy One for transgressors,
	the blameless One for the wicked, the righteous One for the unrighteous,
	the incorruptible One for the corruptible, the immortal One for those
	who are mortal. For what other thing was capable of covering our sins
	than His righteousness? By what other one was it possible that we,
	the wicked and ungodly, could be justified, than by the only Son of God?
	O sweet exchange! O unsearchable operation! O benefits surpassing all
	expectation! That the wickedness of many should be hid in a single righteous
	One, and that the righteousness of One should justify many transgressors!”

One last word. God has already appointed a day. He has already fixed a time where he will judge the world with righteous judgement, through Jesus Christ. Jesus will judge the entire world, every man, woman, and child. Be overwhelmed now at his patience and love toward you. Do not wait, and be overwhelmed on that day at the weight of his eternal holy justice. God does not delight in the death of the wicked, but in overwhelming love, invites us to “turn and live”(Ezekiel 18).

## Our Response

Heavenly Father, You are holy and perfect in all of your ways. I confess I do not sense the awesome power of Your warnings and promises in Your word as I ought. Help my unbelief. I draw near to You to ask for your mercy in my need, and ask that You would aid me in renewing my mind. Increase my faith, and allow me to walk in humility and reverence before You. Help me to see You as Judge of all the earth, and as my Heavenly Father. Thank You for your good news of salvation that can be found in Your Son, Jesus, and your love for me. Let me see the great worth of His blood shed on the cross. I ask You to make me more aware of Your sovereign hand around me. Make my ears attentive to Your voice and Truth, and make my heart like clay in Your hands. I ask it in Jesus’ name, and for His sake. Amen.
