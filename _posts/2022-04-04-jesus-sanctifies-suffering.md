> “This bad thing happened to me, so how could I believe in God?” 

I think that question only rises because we know there is a good that we lack. We know there is a Good and Right, so we naturally discern the evil. 

## Good, Evil, & Suffering

Our longing for Goodness shows there is a paradise lost. The fact that we know and hate evil shows there exists a Good for which we were created and from which we have fallen. There is a longing for paradise within us. And does that not show you we have a Creator, a good Creator?

The reality of evil in the world is there though. We see and know there is evil around us. That is explained by what the Bible calls sin.

## Atheism & the Void 

Now under Atheism, there is no commentary to make on suffering. There are no value statements you can make. You cannot call it bad, for who has decided what good is? You cannot call it unfair, for what standard of justice can the laws of physics dictate? It is expected, and it is meaningless. It means nothing. There is no reward, no punishment. There are just molecules banging together. There is just the inevitable heat-death of the universe and the random bogglings within it right now. 

So suffering means nothing. Success means nothing. Pleasure means nothing. Hardship means nothing. The child rapist means nothing. It's just them obeying the laws of physics. It is just them obeying their DNA. So suffering means absolutely nothing, and people going through suffering have absolutely no hope but chance. It absolutely means nothing, and there is no meaning to it. I don't think that the human soul can really accept that. It is so contradictory to our experience of morality that it is like convincing a living, breathing man that he is not breathing. Even if you could convinve him that his breathing is an illusion, it would not change the fact he is indeed breathing.  

## A Moral Universe

The atheist cannot logically shake his fist at heaven, because there is no such thing. He cannot be angry at the devil and forces of evil, because there is no such thing as evil. The mass murderer, the wife-beater, the child molester, is not evil per-se, he is just us “dancing to his DNA” as Richard Dawkins has so quaintly puts it. And the suffering inflicted by these “dances” means nothing. The victim experiences a complex chemical reaction that evolved to help us reproduce, which we call “pain, trauma, and anguish” It means nothing, it just is. 

This kind of godless world is so manifestly false to our inner being. We all at our core know that suffering is not meaningless, or at least we know that Evil is evil. The very fact that we tend to shake our fist at God shows that we cannot bear the idea of meaningless suffering. But the fact that we cannot bear it points to Him being Creator and making us with a Compass, the conscience and the soul, pointing true North: back to paradise. 

The point that Atheism often breaks down is right here. The contradictory footing is seen in the sentimehnt expressed by this quote:

> A Christian and an Atheist were on thier lunch break "talkin' religion" again. The Atheist, a litte heated today, said, "There is no God, and I hate him!" 

All our movies and stories are about suffering having a meaning. All our ideas about morality are ultimately a complete illusion if God is not on the throne of the universe. A moral universe, which only comes about through a Creator, is the prerequisite for all rational thought and human interaction.

## Suffering & the Incarnation

If you’ve been to a small town diner, often on the wall you find a photograph commemorating the time some celebrity ate there. The presence of a famous, special person made the place special. If God came to your house and drank coffee out of a certain mug, then you would always remember and cherish that mug. 

Jesus has lived as a man. He ate at our diner, he drank from our mug. He was fully God, fully Man. He called himself Son of God and Son of Man. One of the many things that makes Christ unique is that He gave meaning to suffering. Jesus, the eternal Son of God, became a man. He became incarnate. He truly became a man; it is not just that he appeared to be. That means he felt pain. That means he was tempted as we are (Hebrews 4:15).

Jesus sanctified suffering. That is to say that he made it holy. Today, a popular symbol for his servants is a cross: A tool of suffering and execution used by the Romans. Billions of people every day remember the story of his brutal suffering and crucifixion, with surprising joy and thankfulness. What has ever had that effect?

We do not always know the purpose of our suffering. But there are a few things that we do know.

- God did not create the world with suffering, but it is a result of sin
- God uses suffering to purify us 
- Christ has suffered first, and calls me to follow Him.
- God will soon put an ultimate end to His people’s suffering

Because Christ has suffered, suffering has meaning. Jesus stands alive on the other side of death, having conquered it. One gets the sense that, “if he loved me so much, and suffered for me, I know I can get through this with his help.” We get the sense that we are not alone in our suffering. We have a Savior who suffered. 

## Conclusion 

There is much, much more to say on this topic. The best advice I can give is to read through the Scriptures and see the examples contained there of conquering througn suffeing. In summary, were never promised a life free from suffering, and we all encounter it. The best place to find refuge from the storm of suffering is on the firm foundation of Jesus Christ, who can sympathize with our weakness because he knows what it is like. With Him you can withstand the rains with joy. 

Read the gospels. See the Savior of all, the King of kings, the one who made the Milky Way, the one who was before time, with a crown of thorns on his head being nailed into a cross. There is something about that picture that is so weighty that it is almost unbearable.

Jesus was fully innocent and went to a cross and suffered for you, that ultimately  you may be freed from suffering in His kingdom. He suffered, and died and rose for you. Put your faith in him. And when you see Him, He will still have his scars, but you won’t have any of yours any more.
