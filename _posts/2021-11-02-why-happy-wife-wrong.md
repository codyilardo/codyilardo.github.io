## The Saying 
> "Happy wife, happy life"   

This is a common saying today in our culture. It is a common saying even in the church. One preacher even said that the key to a happy marriage is the phrase "Yes, ma'am." These are sayings that would evoke a chuckle from the congregation, but are they true?

## An Illustration
I want to paint a scene: Imagine it is afternoon in the Garden of Eden. You were speaking with Adam this morning, and had left him with the advice, "Happy wife, happy life." Now you are watching Satan tempt Eve. You see Eve fall. Then, you see her offer the fruit to Adam, who has been passively standing there. 
Should Adam apply your advice?
One could say that *he did apply your advice*, and all of us, in Adam, have tasted the fruit of it. 

## The Error
This saying on the surface may seem innocent enough, but it puts things in the wrong order.   
While it is true that husbands should want their wives to be happy, there is a misordering of priorities. A husband's mission is not to make his wife happy. His mission is not to be passive and serve her emotions. In the short term this may seem to make her happy, but in the long term will actually be unloving, and will leave her God-designed sense of purpose as a helper and co-laborer with Adam to be unfulfilled.  

A better expression would be, "God-honoring life, happy wife," or "Righteous life, happy wife." If a man and his wife are true disciples of Christ, then the true happiness in their marriage will come from following the path that Christ laid out for them. There will be great happiness, but there will also be situations where seeking the happiness of his wife would cause a man to make foolish or even sinful decisions, which God will hold him accountable for.

> And to Adam he said,
> “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife
> 	and have eaten of the tree
> of which I commanded you,
> 	‘You shall not eat of it,’
> cursed is the ground because of you;
> 	in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life... (Genesis 3:17 ESV)

## Conclusion 
A wife's happiness should be very important to her husband. Husbands are commanded to love, nourish, and cherish their wives. Scripture says that "He who loves his wife, loves himself" in the book of Ephesians. But that love is the same kind of love Christ shows to the church. Jesus did not primarily seek to make us happy. He sought our true good, which is not always the same thing as our immediate happiness.  

Her happiness will be the *by-product* of the marriage following the mission of God, the husband leading the marriage as the head, and loving and cherishing her like Christ does for His Church.
