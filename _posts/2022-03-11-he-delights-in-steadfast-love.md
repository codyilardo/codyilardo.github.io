## Introduction

Q. What is forgiveness?
Q. How does God deal with the sins of his people?

God’s preferred way of dealing with sin:

God’s Way       | Satan’s Way
----------------|-------------
Fear of God     | Pride
Repentance      | Give Up
**Forgiveness** | Guilt


God's forgiveness is what we are going to be focusing on today.

## The Text

Micah was a prophet writing 700 years before Christ. He spoke of the coming judgment to Israel for their rebellion to God. This is the last few verses of Micah. Here, the prophet shifts to speaking to God. The tone changes to a hopeful one:

    [18] Who is a God like you, pardoning iniquity
        and passing over transgression
        for the remnant of his inheritance?
    He does not retain his anger forever,
        because he delights in steadfast love.
    [19] He will again have compassion on us;
        he will tread our iniquities underfoot.
    You will cast all our sins
        into the depths of the sea.
    [20] You will show faithfulness to Jacob
        and steadfast love to Abraham,
    as you have sworn to our fathers
        from the days of old. (Micah 7:18–20)

## Forgiveness Is

## Unique

First off, God’s forgiveness is unique. Verse 18 says, “Who is a God like you…pardoning iniquity?” This is actually a word pun, as Micah means “Who is like the LORD?” 

The living God is unique because he forgives. If we look at the Islamic god, the Hindu gods, or the pagan idols of Micah’s day, there is nothing **even close** to biblical redemption. Redemption is only found in Jesus Christ. Redemption is a Christian concept.
 
    [6] “Seek the LORD while he may be found;
        call upon him while he is near;
    [7] let the wicked forsake his way,
        and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
    let him return to the LORD, that he may have compassion on him,
        and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
    [8] For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
        neither are your ways my ways, declares the LORD.
    [9] For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
        so are my ways higher than your ways
        and my thoughts than your thoughts. (Isaiah 55:6–9)

His ways are higher than ours : He forgives. Fallen man does not. Man does not forgive like God does. He is unique from all others, but *especially* in his forgiveness.

## Undeserved

God’s forgiveness is undeserved. Many shake their fist at God and say, “God is not fair!” And that is right. If he was fair, we would each not be breathing another breath on His green earth. 

Forgiveness, one sense, is not fair. We get what we don’t deserve: Another chance. 
In Ezekiel, the Lord says, “The soul that sins shall die.” No exception. 

So how can a holy, perfect God forgive? How does God forgive? HOW? 

How can he let evil men off the hook? That is heaven’s question, and *Christ is heaven’s answer.*

The Father sent his only son to die for our sins. Our punishment was on him.  

For there is no distinction: [23] for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, [24] and are *justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus*, [25] whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. [26] It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that *he might be just and the justifier* of the one who has faith in Jesus. (Romans 3:22–26) 

Because Christ has borne our punishment, God passes over our sins. He counts us as innocent and cleansed from our law breaking. Jesus perfectly kept the law of God, so he could die as a sinless sacrifice for us. 

God delights in showing steadfast love to you. He loved you and sent his Son to become a man, and to go through the most horrible death. For you. *He delights* in showing that steadfast love. It is not begrudgingly given. It is lavishly given. 

Jesus Christ was crucified, rejected and condemned by his people, though he was an innocent man. **He did not deserve judgment. We do not deserve forgiveness.** That is the great exchange, where Jesus took our guilt and gave us mercy. 

## Unchanging     

God’s forgiveness is unchanging. Have you had any people who said they had your back and then stabbed you in it? God will never change his ways. Even when we have been faithless he remains faithful.

He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. His promises to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David, and the other righteous men of old have been fulfilled, even thousands of years after thier death. God forgave the sin of king David, looking forward to the day when the Son of David would die for the sins of all men of all time that repent toward God and put thier faith in him. 

## Conculsion

So do not fail to recieve the forgiveness of God: He delights to show his steadfast love to those who turn to him.
