# About

Hello, welcome to my website. On the occasion I have thoughts, I put some of them here. 

My name is Cody Ilardo. I am a disciple of Christ, who loved me and freed me from my sins by his blood (Revelation 1:5-6). I work in software development by trade. I enjoy many good gifts from God, but some of my favorites are [reading](https://codyilardo.com/blog/2020-08-07-rec-reading.md) old books, Florida's rivers, and the wife's cooking.
